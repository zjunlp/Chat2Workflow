The Template node aggregates summaries, and the Markdown Exporter converts the output to a DOCX file, which is consistent with the design principle. The List Operator ensures a single DOCX file output, and the End node outputs both the summary text and the DOCX file. The workflow structure does not violate the design principle.

Below is a **detailed, structured legal review** of the contract from the **Tenant’s perspective**, with **improvement suggestions** aimed at **maximizing Tenant’s interests** while remaining realistic within the house rental industry context.\n\n---\n\n# 🏠 **Contract Review: Security Deposit Clause & Related Provisions (Tenant-Focused)**\n\n## 🔍 **OVERVIEW**\nThe current lease contains a **basic security deposit clause (Section “DEPOSIT”)** that is **vague, landlord-favorable, and lacks tenant protections** required by most state laws. It does not comply with key checkpoints for fairness, transparency, or legal defensibility — especially regarding return timelines, itemization, dispute resolution, or definitions of wear and tear.\n\n---\n\n# ✅ **CHECKPOINT-BY-CHECKPOINT ANALYSIS & RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Deposit Amount & Legal Cap Compliance**\n\n### ❌ Current Status:\n- No mention of whether deposit complies with state/local law.\n- No cap specified.\n- No distinction between general deposit and non-refundable fees.\n\n### ✅ Recommendation:\n> **Add:**  \n> _“The security deposit shall not exceed [insert state limit, e.g., one month’s rent] as permitted under [State] law. Any amount designated as ‘non-refundable’ must be clearly labeled as such in writing and must be legally permissible under applicable law.”_\n\n> **Also add:**  \n> _“If Landlord collects more than the legally permitted amount, Tenant may demand refund of excess within 14 days of move-in, or deduct it from first month’s rent.”_\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Clear Definition of “Normal Wear and Tear”**\n\n### ❌ Current Status:\n- Vague phrase: “other than reasonable wear and tear” — no examples or definitions.\n- Leaves room for arbitrary deductions.\n\n### ✅ Recommendation:\n> **Insert definition clause:**  \n> _“‘Normal wear and tear’ includes minor scuff marks on walls, faded paint due to sunlight, worn carpeting from regular foot traffic, and minor scratches on appliances. It does NOT include holes in walls, broken fixtures, pet damage, stains beyond normal use, or missing items.”_\n\n> **Optional Enhancement:**  \n> _“Landlord agrees that any deduction claimed for ‘wear and tear’ must be supported by photographic evidence taken at move-in and move-out.”_\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Itemized Deduction Requirements**\n\n### ❌ Current Status:\n- No requirement for itemization.\n- No need for receipts or estimates.\n- Landlord can deduct without justification.\n\n### ✅ Recommendation:\n> **Revise Deposit Section to Include:**  \n> _“Within 21 days after Tenant vacates and returns keys, Landlord shall provide Tenant with an itemized statement of all deductions from the security deposit, including: (i) description of each deduction; (ii) cost of repair/replacement; (iii) copies of invoices or receipts supporting each charge; and (iv) explanation of how each charge relates to Tenant’s breach of this Agreement. Failure to provide this statement constitutes forfeiture of right to deduct.”_\n\n> **Also Add:**  \n> _“Deductions must be based on actual costs incurred, not estimated or inflated amounts.”_\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Return Deadline Clause**\n\n### ❌ Current Status:\n- No deadline stated.\n- No penalties for late return.\n\n### ✅ Recommendation:\n> **Add:**  \n> _“Landlord shall return the full security deposit, or balance thereof after lawful deductions, within 21 calendar days following Tenant’s surrender of possession and return of keys. If Landlord fails to return the deposit or provide itemized deductions within this period, Tenant shall be entitled to recover triple the amount wrongfully withheld plus attorney fees under [State] law.”_\n\n> *(Note: Adjust timeline per local law — e.g., CA = 21 days, NY = 14–30 days)*\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Pre-Move-Out Inspection Clause**\n\n### ❌ Current Status:\n- Not mentioned.\n- No opportunity for Tenant to inspect before final accounting.\n\n### ✅ Recommendation:\n> **Insert New Clause:**  \n> _“At least 7 days prior to termination of tenancy, Landlord shall conduct a joint walk-through inspection with Tenant. Tenant may attend and note any discrepancies in writing. Any issues identified during this inspection shall be resolved prior to final move-out unless mutually agreed otherwise.”_\n\n> **Bonus Suggestion:**  \n> _“Failure to schedule pre-move-out inspection waives Landlord’s right to claim damages not visible during final inspection.”_\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Deposit Holding Account & Interest Provisions**\n\n### ❌ Current Status:\n- Silent on where deposit is held.\n- No mention of interest.\n\n### ✅ Recommendation:\n> **Add:**  \n> _“Security deposit shall be held in a separate, interest-bearing account in a federally insured financial institution located in [State]. If required by law, Tenant shall receive accrued interest annually or upon termination of tenancy, whichever occurs first.”_\n\n> **Clarify:**  \n> _“Landlord shall notify Tenant in writing within 10 days of receipt of deposit of the name and location of the holding bank.”_\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Tenant’s Right to Dispute Deductions**\n\n### ❌ Current Status:\n- No process outlined.\n- No appeal mechanism.\n\n### ✅ Recommendation:\n> **Insert Dispute Clause:**  \n> _“If Tenant disputes any deduction, Tenant may submit written notice of objection within 14 days of receiving the itemized statement. Landlord shall respond within 14 days. If unresolved, either party may initiate mediation or file suit in small claims court without penalty.”_\n\n> **Also Add:**  \n> _“In case of dispute, Landlord bears burden of proof to substantiate deductions.”_\n\n---\n\n## 8. **Documentation Requirements for Landlord**\n\n### ❌ Current Status:\n- Mentions Tenant accepts premises “as-is,” but no documentation requirement for Landlord.\n- No photos/video mandated.\n\n### ✅ Recommendation:\n> **Amend Maintenance Section to Require:**  \n> _“Landlord shall provide Tenant with a signed Move-In Condition Report, accompanied by dated photographs or video footage of all rooms, fixtures, appliances, and exterior areas, within 7 days of move-in. Tenant shall sign and return the report within 7 days. Failure to do so shall not waive Tenant’s rights, but failure by Landlord to provide such documentation shall create presumption that premises were in good condition at move-in.”_\n\n> **Also Add:**  \n> _“Landlord shall retain all records related to deposit, repairs, inspections, and communications for at least three (3) years post-tenancy.”_\n\n---\n\n## 9. **Penalties for Non-Compliance**\n\n### ❌ Current Status:\n- Only general “prevailing party gets attorney fees” clause (Section “ATTORNEY’S FEES”) — doesn’t apply specifically to deposit violations.\n\n### ✅ Recommendation:\n> **Add Specific Penalty Clause Under Deposit Section:**  \n> _“Failure by Landlord to comply with deposit return obligations under this Agreement or applicable law shall entitle Tenant to statutory penalties up to three times the amount wrongfully withheld, plus court costs and reasonable attorney fees, regardless of whether suit is filed.”_\n\n> **Reference Local Law:**  \n> _“This provision supplements, but does not replace, remedies available under [State] Civil Code § ___ or similar statutes.”_\n\n---\n\n## 10. **Jurisdiction-Specific Compliance**\n\n### ❌ Current Status:\n- No reference to local/state law.\n- Assumes uniformity across jurisdictions.\n\n### ✅ Recommendation:\n> **Insert Governing Law + Compliance Clause:**  \n> _“This Agreement shall be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws of [State], including its provisions governing residential security deposits (e.g., [cite specific statute]). In the event of conflict between this Agreement and applicable law, the law shall prevail.”_\n\n> **Also Add:**  \n> _“Landlord warrants that this Agreement has been reviewed for compliance with all applicable city, county, and state regulations as of the date of execution.”_\n\n---\n\n## 11. **Communication Protocol**\n\n### ❌ Current Status:\n- General notice clause only mentions mail.\n- No requirement for forwarding address or electronic confirmation.\n\n### ✅ Recommendation:\n> **Revise Notice Section to Include:**  \n> _“All notices regarding deposit return, deductions, or disputes shall be sent via certified mail AND email (if provided), with read receipt requested. Tenant shall update forwarding address in writing within 7 days of move-out. Failure to provide updated address does not relieve Landlord of obligation to return deposit.”_\n\n> **Also Add:**  \n> _“Electronic delivery shall constitute valid notice if Tenant acknowledges receipt via reply email or text message.”_\n\n---\n\n## 12. **Co-Tenant & Subletting Clauses**\n\n### ❌ Current Status:\n- Joint liability clause exists (Section 25).\n- No clarity on individual deposit rights.\n\n### ✅ Recommendation:\n> **Clarify Co-Tenant Rights:**  \n> _“If multiple Tenants are listed, each Tenant shall have equal right to receive deposit return information and contest deductions. Landlord may not withhold deposit from one co-Tenant due to actions of another unless proven jointly liable.”_\n\n> **For Sublets (Section 24):**  \n> _“If Tenant sublets with Landlord’s consent, original Tenant remains responsible for deposit unless Landlord releases them in writing. New subtenant may deposit separate security deposit, which must also comply with all terms herein.”_\n\n---\n\n## 13. **Early Termination Impact**\n\n### ❌ Current Status:\n- Silent on early termination impact on deposit.\n\n### ✅ Recommendation:\n> **Add Clause:**  \n> _“In the event of early termination with Landlord’s consent, Landlord shall return the security deposit minus lawful deductions within 21 days, unless Tenant abandons property or breaches agreement. Deposit shall not be forfeited solely because of early termination if premises are left clean and undamaged.”_\n\n> **Exception Clause:**  \n> _“If Tenant terminates early without cause and Landlord incurs re-rental expenses, those costs may be deducted only if documented and proportional to actual loss.”_\n\n---\n\n## 14. **Insurance vs. Deposit Clarification**\n\n### ❌ Current Status:\n- No distinction made.\n- Risk of double-charging (e.g., insurance claim + deposit deduction).\n\n### ✅ Recommendation:\n> **Insert Clause:**  \n> _“Landlord agrees not to seek reimbursement from Tenant’s security deposit for damages already covered by Landlord’s insurance policy. If Landlord receives insurance proceeds for repairs caused by Tenant, Landlord shall credit such amount against any deposit deduction.”_\n\n> **Also Add:**  \n> _“Tenant shall not be charged for repairs resulting from acts of God, natural disasters, or third-party negligence unrelated to Tenant’s conduct.”_\n\n---\n\n## 15. **Final Walk-Through Agreement**\n\n### ❌ Current Status:\n- Not required.\n- No mutual sign-off.\n\n### ✅ Recommendation:\n> **Insert Final Inspection Clause:**  \n> _“On or before the last day of tenancy, Landlord and Tenant shall conduct a joint final inspection. Both parties shall complete and sign a Final Condition Report. Any disagreements shall be noted in writing and attached to the report. Absent mutual agreement, Landlord’s unilateral assessment shall not be binding without supporting documentation.”_\n\n> **Enforceability Tip:**  \n> _“Failure to conduct final inspection voids Landlord’s right to deduct for unknown or undocumented conditions.”_\n\n---\n\n# ⚖️ **ADDITIONAL CRITICAL ISSUES BEYOND SECURITY DEPOSIT CHECKPOINTS**\n\n---\n\n## 💣 **Problematic Clause: “Non-Refundable Portion” of Deposit**\n\n> **Current Text:**  \n> _“A portion of the security deposit, in the amount of $________, shall be non-refundable, and shall be applied toward Landlord’s costs of preparing the Premises for occupancy by others.”_\n\n### ❗ Issue:\n- This is **illegal in many states** (e.g., CA, NY, IL, MA) — cannot label part of security deposit as “non-refundable.”\n- Often deemed an illegal fee disguised as deposit.\n\n### ✅ Fix:\n> **Replace Entire Sentence With:**  \n> _“Landlord may charge a separate, non-refundable cleaning or preparation fee ONLY if explicitly disclosed in writing at signing, separately itemized, and compliant with state law. Such fee shall not be deducted from the security deposit.”_\n\n> **Or Better Yet:**  \n> _“No portion of the security deposit shall be non-refundable. All funds collected as security deposit are fully refundable subject to lawful deductions under this Agreement and applicable law.”_\n\n---\n\n## 🧨 **Mold Waiver (Section 23)**\n\n> **Current Text:**  \n> _“Tenant waives any and all claims... Landlord shall not be liable for any damages... resulting from mold or mildew.”_\n\n### ❗ Issue:\n- Unenforceable in most jurisdictions — landlords cannot waive liability for health hazards.\n- Violates implied warranty of habitability.\n\n### ✅ Fix:\n> **Delete Entire Section 23 OR Revise As Follows:**  \n> _“Tenant agrees to promptly report any signs of moisture, water leaks, or mold growth to Landlord. Landlord shall remediate known mold issues within 14 days of notification. Tenant shall not be held liable for mold resulting from structural defects, plumbing failures, or lack of ventilation attributable to Landlord.”_\n\n> **Add:**  \n> _“This clause does not affect Tenant’s rights under [State] housing codes or public health laws.”_\n\n---\n\n## 🛑 **Waiver of Attorney Fees Clause (Section “ATTORNEY’S FEES”)**\n\n> **Current Text:**  \n> _“Prevailing party entitled to attorney fees…”_\n\n### ❗ Issue:\n- May discourage tenants from enforcing rights if they fear high legal costs.\n- Some states require reciprocal fee-shifting for residential leases.\n\n### ✅ Fix:\n> **Add Reciprocity Language:**  \n> _“Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Tenant prevails in any action to enforce deposit return or other tenant rights under this Agreement or applicable law, Tenant shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees and costs even if Landlord is technically the ‘prevailing party’ in some aspects of litigation.”_\n\n> **Cite Statute (if applicable):**  \n> _“This clause complies with [State] law requiring reciprocity in attorney fee awards for residential tenancies.”_\n\n---\n\n## 📉 **Late Fee & Interest Rate (Section “MONTHLY RENT”)**\n\n> **Current Text:**  \n> _“$50 late fee… interest at 15% per year…”_\n\n### ❗ Issue:\n- 15% annual interest may exceed legal caps in some states (e.g., max 5–10% in CA/NY).\n- Late fee may be unconscionable if disproportionate.\n\n### ✅ Fix:\n> **Cap Rates Per State Law:**  \n> _“Late fee shall not exceed $[state max] or 5% of monthly rent, whichever is less. Interest on overdue amounts shall accrue at the maximum rate allowed by [State] law, currently [X]% annually.”_\n\n> **Add Reasonableness Clause:**  \n> _“Any late fee or interest exceeding statutory limits shall be unenforceable and waived.”_\n\n---\n\n# 📋 **SUMMARY OF KEY IMPROVEMENTS TO MAXIMIZE TENANT INTERESTS**\n\n| Area | Current Flaw | Recommended Fix |\n|------|--------------|------------------|\n| Deposit Cap | None | Add state-compliant cap + disclosure |\n| Non-Refundable Fee | Illegal structure | Remove or convert to separate, disclosed fee |\n| Itemization | Missing | Mandate detailed breakdown + receipts |\n| Return Timeline | Undefined | Set 21-day deadline + penalties |\n| Pre-Move-Out Inspection | Not offered | Require joint walkthrough |\n| Documentation | No photo/video mandate | Require signed checklist + media |\n| Dispute Process | None | Outline written objection + mediation path |\n| Mold Waiver | Overbroad/unenforceable | Limit to tenant-caused mold only |\n| Attorney Fees | One-sided | Add reciprocity for tenant wins |\n| Interest/Late Fees | Possibly excessive | Cap per state law |\n| Jurisdiction Compliance | Ignored | Explicitly tie to local statutes |\n\n---\n\n# 🧭 **STRATEGIC NEXT STEPS FOR TENANT**\n\n1. **Negotiate Addendum**: Propose these changes as a **written addendum** signed by both parties before signing the main lease.\n2. **Request Move-In Checklist + Photos**: Insist on completing and signing this before moving in.\n3. **Document Everything**: Take your own photos/videos upon move-in and move-out.\n4. **Keep Records**: Save all communication, receipts, and notices for at least 3 years.\n5. **Consult Local Tenant Union or Legal Aid**: Many offer free review services for residential leases.\n6. **File Complaint if Needed**: Know your state’s housing authority contact info for deposit disputes.\n\n---\n\n# 📄 FINAL NOTE: TEMPLATE UPGRADE SUGGESTION\n\nConsider replacing this template with a **state-specific, tenant-friendly lease** from reputable sources like:\n\n- **Nolo.com** – Offers customizable, legally reviewed templates\n- **State Bar Associations** – Often provide free sample leases\n- **Local Housing Authorities** – May offer approved forms\n\n---\n\n# ✅ CONCLUSION\n\nWhile the current lease serves the **Landlord’s interests well**, it exposes the **Tenant to significant risk**, particularly around **security deposit recovery**. By implementing the above improvements — especially **clear itemization, defined wear-and-tear standards, mandatory inspections, and statutory penalties** — you significantly increase your chances of getting your deposit back fairly and avoid costly disputes.\n\n**Your goal should be to turn this one-sided contract into a balanced, transparent, and legally compliant agreement that protects your rights as a tenant.**\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to generate a **revised version of the entire lease** incorporating all these changes? Or create a **customizable Word/PDF template** tailored to your state?\n\nLet me know — I’m happy to help further!",

    "llm_output_test2": "result: Contract Risk Review Report:\n\nAnalysis and Suggestions:\nCertainly. Below is a **detailed, structured analysis and improvement suggestions** for the **Duration of Confidentiality** clause in the provided Confidential Disclosure Agreement (CDA), with a focus on **maximizing the interests of the Recipient** — in this case, **President and Fellows of Harvard College (“Harvard”)** — while ensuring legal enforceability, alignment with industry norms, and mitigation of future risk.\n\n---\n\n# ✅ **Contract Review: Duration of Confidentiality Clause – Targeted to Maximize Harvard’s Interests**\n\n## 📌 Contract Text Under Review:\n> **Section 8. Termination; Return of Confidential Information.**  \n> *The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and expire on the date that is two (2) years later. Either party may terminate this Agreement sooner upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other party. In any event, the Receiving Party’s non-disclosure and non-use obligations under this Agreement with respect to Confidential Information it has received hereunder shall not expire until the date that is five (5) years after the Effective Date.*\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 CHECKPOINT-BY-CHECKPOINT ANALYSIS & IMPROVEMENTS\n\n---\n\n### **1. Explicit Term Definition**  \n✅ **Current Status**: The agreement clearly states that confidentiality obligations survive the termination of the agreement and last **five (5) years from the Effective Date**, regardless of early termination.  \n🟢 **Assessment**: Satisfactory. Clear and specific.  \n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:  \n> Add language to clarify that “five (5) years from the Effective Date” applies **regardless of when disclosure occurred**, unless otherwise specified. This avoids ambiguity if disclosures are made late in the agreement term.\n\n> ✏️ **Recommended Addition**:  \n> _“The five (5) year confidentiality obligation applies to all Confidential Information disclosed during the term of this Agreement, whether disclosed at the beginning or end of such term.”_\n\n---\n\n### **2. Differentiation Between General & Trade Secret Information**  \n❌ **Current Status**: No distinction is made between general confidential information and trade secrets. All information is subject to the same 5-year term.  \n🔴 **Risk**: Under U.S. law (e.g., Uniform Trade Secrets Act), trade secrets may be protected indefinitely if properly maintained as secret. A fixed 5-year term may undermine protection for truly proprietary, long-lived trade secrets disclosed under this CDA.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:  \n> Insert carve-out for trade secrets to extend protection beyond 5 years — **indefinitely**, unless the information ceases to qualify as a trade secret.\n\n> ✏️ **Recommended Addition**:  \n> _“Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party’s obligations with respect to Confidential Information that constitutes a ‘trade secret’ under applicable law (including but not limited to the Uniform Trade Secrets Act) shall continue indefinitely, so long as such information remains a trade secret and is not disclosed through no fault of the Receiving Party.”_\n\n---\n\n### **3. Survival Clause Alignment**  \n✅ **Current Status**: Section 8 explicitly states that confidentiality obligations survive termination — good practice.  \n🟢 **Assessment**: Strong. Survives termination and even early termination.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:  \n> Reinforce survival by referencing it in the “Miscellaneous” section or add a dedicated “Survival” clause for clarity and emphasis.\n\n> ✏️ **Recommended Addition to Section 10 (Miscellaneous)**:  \n> _“The provisions of Sections 2 (Definition), 3 (Nondisclosure), 4 (Required Disclosure), 5 (Limitation on Use), 6 (Ownership), 7 (Disclaimer), and 8 (Termination; Return of Confidential Information) shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement.”_\n\n---\n\n### **4. Jurisdictional Compliance**  \n✅ **Current Status**: Governing law is Massachusetts — which recognizes indefinite protection for trade secrets under M.G.L. c. 93H.  \n🟢 **Assessment**: Compliant with state law. However, lacks specificity regarding trade secret treatment.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:  \n> Explicitly reference Massachusetts trade secret law to strengthen enforceability and align with local precedent.\n\n> ✏️ **Recommended Addition to Section 8**:  \n> _“To the extent any Confidential Information qualifies as a trade secret under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 93H, the Receiving Party’s obligations shall continue indefinitely, consistent with such statute.”_\n\n---\n\n### **5. Post-Term Return or Destruction Obligation**  \n✅ **Current Status**: Requires return or destruction of materials upon termination or upon Disclosing Party’s request. Allows retention of one copy for compliance monitoring.  \n🟢 **Assessment**: Reasonable and industry-standard.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:  \n> Clarify that “one copy” retained must be stored securely and accessible only to legal/compliance personnel — not researchers or commercial teams.\n\n> ✏️ **Recommended Addition to Section 8**:  \n> _“Any retained copy shall be stored in a secure location, accessible only to legal, compliance, or designated administrative personnel solely for the purpose of monitoring compliance with this Agreement.”_\n\n---\n\n### **6. Renewal or Extension Provisions**  \n✅ **Current Status**: No automatic renewal or extension provisions — neutral.  \n🟢 **Assessment**: Avoids unintended extensions — favorable to Recipient (Harvard), who may wish to limit long-term obligations.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:  \n> Add an explicit statement that **no renewal or extension shall occur without mutual written agreement**.\n\n> ✏️ **Recommended Addition to Section 8**:  \n> _“This Agreement and its confidentiality obligations shall not be automatically renewed or extended beyond the terms herein, unless expressly agreed in writing by both parties.”_\n\n---\n\n### **7. Carve-Outs for Publicly Available Information**  \n✅ **Current Status**: Section 2 includes carve-outs for information that becomes publicly known without breach — well-drafted.  \n🟢 **Assessment**: Strong. Protects Recipient from liability for info that enters public domain legitimately.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:  \n> Add a provision clarifying that **if information becomes public due to Disclosing Party’s action**, the Recipient is immediately released from obligations for that information.\n\n> ✏️ **Recommended Addition to Section 2**:  \n> _“If Confidential Information becomes publicly available due to the Disclosing Party’s own actions (including but not limited to publication, presentation, or regulatory filing), the Receiving Party’s obligations with respect to such information shall immediately cease.”_\n\n---\n\n### **8. Industry-Specific Standards**  \n🟡 **Current Status**: 5-year term is common in academia/tech collaborations, but may be **too short** for high-value R&D, biotech, or algorithmic data — especially if disclosures involve pre-clinical research, proprietary methods, or AI models.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:  \n> For fields like **biotech, AI, or deep tech**, consider extending duration to **7–10 years**, or allow for **case-by-case extension** based on nature of disclosure.\n\n> ✏️ **Recommended Addition to Section 8**:  \n> _“For Confidential Information relating to proprietary algorithms, therapeutic compounds, or preclinical research data, the parties may agree in writing to extend the confidentiality period beyond five (5) years, up to ten (10) years from the Effective Date, subject to mutual consent.”_\n\n---\n\n### **9. Perpetual vs. Fixed Term Justification**  \n🔴 **Current Status**: No justification for 5-year term — arbitrary. Could be challenged as unreasonable if information retains value beyond 5 years.  \n⚠️ **Risk**: Courts may strike down overly broad or unjustified durations — especially if tied to trade secrets.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:  \n> Add a **reasonableness clause** justifying the 5-year term for general info, while preserving indefinite protection for trade secrets.\n\n> ✏️ **Recommended Addition to Section 8**:  \n> _“The five (5) year term is intended to reflect a reasonable balance between protecting legitimate business interests and avoiding undue restriction on the Receiving Party’s ability to operate. For information that qualifies as a trade secret, the protections shall continue indefinitely, as permitted by law.”_\n\n---\n\n### **10. Termination Triggers Affecting Duration**  \n✅ **Current Status**: Section 8 correctly states that confidentiality survives termination — strong.  \n🟢 **Assessment**: Well-structured. Early termination does not shorten confidentiality period.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:  \n> Clarify that **even if the agreement is terminated for cause (e.g., breach)**, confidentiality obligations remain intact — to prevent bad actors from escaping obligations via termination.\n\n> ✏️ **Recommended Addition to Section 8**:  \n> _“Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, including termination for breach, the Receiving Party’s confidentiality and non-use obligations shall remain in full force and effect for the duration specified herein.”_\n\n---\n\n### **11. Notice Requirements for Expiration**  \n❌ **Current Status**: No notice required before confidentiality expires — standard, but could leave Harvard vulnerable if Company forgets or ignores expiration.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:  \n> Add optional notice mechanism to remind parties of upcoming expiration — protects Harvard from inadvertent disclosure post-expiration.\n\n> ✏️ **Recommended Addition to Section 8**:  \n> _“Upon request by either party, the other party shall provide written confirmation, within fifteen (15) days, of whether any Confidential Information remains subject to ongoing obligations under this Agreement.”_\n\n---\n\n### **12. Enforceability Risk Assessment**  \n🟡 **Current Status**: 5-year term is generally enforceable, but risks being deemed **unreasonable** if applied to trade secrets or highly sensitive data.  \n⚠️ **Risk**: If challenged, court may reduce term or void it entirely for lack of proportionality.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:  \n> Introduce **tiered durations** based on sensitivity level (e.g., 3 years for general info, 5–7 for technical data, indefinite for trade secrets).\n\n> ✏️ **Recommended Revision to Section 8**:  \n> _“The Receiving Party’s obligations shall apply as follows:  \n> (a) For general business or non-technical information: three (3) years from Effective Date;  \n> (b) For scientific, technical, or proprietary data: five (5) years from Effective Date;  \n> (c) For information qualifying as a trade secret under applicable law: indefinitely, so long as it remains a trade secret.  \n> The Disclosing Party shall designate the category of each disclosed item at the time of disclosure, or within thirty (30) days thereof.”_\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 SUMMARY OF KEY IMPROVEMENTS FOR HARVARD’S INTERESTS:\n\n| Area | Current Weakness | Improvement Suggestion |\n|------|------------------|------------------------|\n| **Trade Secret Protection** | Fixed 5-year term undermines indefinite protection | Add indefinite protection for trade secrets |\n| **Clarity on Duration Scope** | Ambiguity re: when 5-year clock starts | Clarify it applies to all disclosures regardless of timing |\n| **Post-Term Retention** | One copy allowed — vague on access | Specify restricted access to legal/compliance only |\n| **Industry Norms** | 5-year term may be too short for high-value R&D | Allow 7–10 year extensions for biotech/AI data |\n| **Enforceability** | Arbitrary duration may be struck down | Tiered durations + reasonableness clause |\n| **Termination Impact** | Good, but could be strengthened | Explicitly state obligations survive termination for cause |\n| **Public Domain Trigger** | Good, but missing Disclosing Party causation | Add clause releasing obligations if Discloser makes info public |\n\n---\n\n## 🏁 FINAL RECOMMENDATION: REVISED SECTION 8 (TERMINATION; RETURN OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION)\n\n> **8. Termination; Return of Confidential Information.**  \n> The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and expire on the date that is two (2) years later. Either party may terminate this Agreement sooner upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other party.  \n>   \n> Notwithstanding termination or expiration, the Receiving Party’s non-disclosure and non-use obligations with respect to Confidential Information received hereunder shall continue as follows:  \n> (a) For general business or non-technical information: three (3) years from the Effective Date;  \n> (b) For scientific, technical, or proprietary data: five (5) years from the Effective Date;  \n> (c) For information qualifying as a “trade secret” under applicable law (including but not limited to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 93H): indefinitely, so long as such information remains a trade secret and is not disclosed through no fault of the Receiving Party.  \n>   \n> The Disclosing Party shall designate the category of each disclosed item at the time of disclosure, or within thirty (30) days thereof. If no designation is made, the default category shall be (b).  \n>   \n> Upon termination of this Agreement, or sooner upon the Disclosing Party’s written request, the Receiving Party shall promptly return to the Disclosing Party all Confidential Information and destroy all copies, summaries, synopses, and abstracts in its possession (whether in written, graphic, or machine-readable form), except that the Receiving Party may retain one (1) copy in its secure, confidential files, accessible only to legal, compliance, or designated administrative personnel solely for monitoring compliance with this Agreement.  \n>   \n> The five (5) year confidentiality obligation applies to all Confidential Information disclosed during the term of this Agreement, whether disclosed at the beginning or end of such term.  \n>   \n> Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, including termination for breach, the Receiving Party’s confidentiality and non-use obligations shall remain in full force and effect for the duration specified herein.  \n>   \n> This Agreement and its confidentiality obligations shall not be automatically renewed or extended beyond the terms herein, unless expressly agreed in writing by both parties.  \n>   \n> Upon request by either party, the other party shall provide written confirmation, within fifteen (15) days, of whether any Confidential Information remains subject to ongoing obligations under this Agreement.\n\n---\n\n## 💡 CONCLUSION\n\nThis revised structure **maximizes Harvard’s protection** by:\n- Preserving **indefinite protection for trade secrets**,\n- Introducing **tiered, justified durations** aligned with industry norms,\n- Strengthening **survival clauses** and **post-term controls**,\n- Reducing **enforceability risk** through specificity and proportionality,\n- Ensuring **clarity and accountability** in classification and retention.\n\nThese changes position Harvard to protect its most valuable intellectual assets while remaining compliant with legal standards and minimizing exposure to litigation or unintended disclosure.\n\nLet me know if you’d like similar reviews for **scope of disclosure**, **remedies**, or **governing law/jurisdiction** clauses.",

Force Majeure & Cancellation Refund Policy**\n\n## 🔍 Current State:\n- **Force Majeure Clause (Section 15)**: Broadly defined (“acts beyond reasonable control”) but lacks specificity regarding **pandemics, venue closures, government bans, or public safety incidents**.\n- **No refund mechanism**: The clause only excuses performance — **no mention of refunds, credits, or termination rights**.\n- **No insurance requirement**.\n- **No Material Adverse Change (MAC) clause**.\n\n## ⚠️ Risks:\n- High capital investment ($_________) with **zero financial recourse** if event is canceled or scaled down.\n- Sponsor may be stuck with no return if event fails due to unforeseen circumstances.\n- “Credit only” clauses are not prohibited — **could be imposed later** via side agreement or verbal understanding.\n\n## 🛠️ Improvement Suggestions:\n\n| Area | Suggested Revision |\n|------|---------------------|\n| **Force Majeure Definition** | Add specific examples: *“including but not limited to pandemics, natural disasters, venue closures, government-mandated shutdowns, travel restrictions, or public health emergencies.”* |\n| **Refund Triggers** | Insert new subsection: *“In the event of cancellation or material reduction in scope due to a Force Majeure Event, Sponsor shall be entitled to a full refund of any unused sponsorship funds within 30 days of cancellation notice.”* |\n| **Refund Timeline** | Explicitly state: *“Refunds shall be processed within 30 calendar days of written notice of cancellation.”* |\n| **No Credit Only Clauses** | Add: *“Sponsor shall not be required to accept future credits, vouchers, or rescheduling as compensation for cancellation or non-performance.”* |\n| **Insurance Requirement** | Add: *“Recipient shall maintain event cancellation insurance covering at least 100% of the sponsorship value, naming Sponsor as an additional insured or loss payee.”* |\n| **MAC Clause** | Add: *“If the event’s scale, audience reach, or brand value is materially diminished (e.g., >30% reduction in attendance, cancellation of key speakers, or negative publicity), Sponsor may terminate this Agreement and receive a pro-rata refund.”* |\n\n> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Consider inserting an **escrow account** for funds to be released upon event completion or milestone achievement.\n\n---\n\n# ✅ **2. Exclusivity & Competitive Sponsorship Restrictions**\n\n## 🔍 Current State:\n- **Section 9 – No Exclusivity**: Explicitly allows Recipient to sponsor **competing brands** in the same sector — **directly undermines brand equity**.\n- No definition of categories, no competitor list, no tiered exclusivity.\n- No audit rights, no remedies for breach.\n- No post-term protection.\n\n## ⚠️ Risks:\n- Competitors can co-sponsor, diluting J&J’s visibility and message.\n- No enforcement mechanism — even if violated, Sponsor has no recourse.\n- Brand association with competitors could harm reputation.\n\n## 🛠️ Improvement Suggestions:\n\n| Area | Suggested Revision |\n|------|---------------------|\n| **Exclusivity Grant** | Replace Section 9 with: *“Sponsor shall be the exclusive sponsor in the [specify category, e.g., ‘healthcare’, ‘pharmaceuticals’, ‘consumer health’] category for the Conference. Recipient shall not accept sponsorship from any entity operating in the same category during the term.”* |\n| **Competitor List** | Add Annex: *“Exhibit C – Prohibited Competitors”*, listing direct competitors (e.g., Pfizer, Merck, GSK) with right to update annually with mutual consent. |\n| **Tiered Rights** | Clarify: *“As Title Sponsor, Sponsor enjoys Category Exclusivity. Other sponsors shall be designated as ‘Supporting Partners’ with no category rights.”* |\n| **Negative Covenant** | Add: *“Recipient covenants not to enter into sponsorship agreements with any entity listed in Exhibit C during the Term.”* |\n| **Right to Audit** | Insert: *“Sponsor shall have the right to review marketing materials, signage, digital content, and third-party activations to ensure compliance with exclusivity terms.”* |\n| **Remedies for Breach** | Add: *“In the event of breach, Sponsor may demand immediate removal of competing branding, receive a proportional refund, and/or terminate this Agreement with 15 days’ notice.”* |\n| **Third-Party Compliance** | Add: *“All vendors, influencers, media partners, and subcontractors engaged by Recipient must comply with exclusivity terms and sign confidentiality/exclusivity addenda.”* |\n| **Post-Term Protection** | Add: *“Exclusivity extends to all post-event promotional materials, including highlight reels, social media recaps, and digital archives, for a period of 6 months following the event.”* |\n\n> 💡 **Negotiation Leverage**: Given J&J’s brand stature and funding size, push for **category exclusivity** as non-negotiable. Offer to waive it only if Recipient provides **bonus exposure** (e.g., dedicated keynote slot, branded content hub).\n\n---\n\n# ✅ **3. Additional Industry-Specific Safeguards**\n\n## 🔍 Current State:\n- **Brand Usage Guidelines (Section 3)**: Strong on approval rights — Sponsor retains **sole discretion** over logo use.\n- **Performance Metrics**: None defined.\n- **Termination for Cause**: Not included.\n- **Governing Law**: New Jersey law + arbitration — acceptable, but lacks speed/brand-friendly forum.\n- **Assignment Clause (Section 13)**: Good — requires consent for assignment.\n\n## ⚠️ Risks:\n- No KPIs = no accountability for ROI.\n- No termination right if event turns scandalous or mismanaged.\n- Arbitration in NJ may delay resolution; no provision for injunctive relief.\n\n## 🛠️ Improvement Suggestions:\n\n| Area | Suggested Revision |\n|------|---------------------|\n| **Performance Metrics** | Add: *“Recipient shall provide monthly reports detailing impressions, reach, sentiment, website traffic, and social engagement attributable to Sponsor’s activation. Failure to meet agreed KPIs (to be defined in Exhibit D) for two consecutive months entitles Sponsor to terminate with 30 days’ notice and receive a pro-rata refund.”* |\n| **Termination for Cause** | Add: *“Sponsor may terminate this Agreement immediately if: (i) Recipient engages in conduct that materially harms Sponsor’s reputation; (ii) Key speakers or talent involved in the event are embroiled in scandal; or (iii) Event is mismanaged to the point of public embarrassment.”* |\n| **Injunctive Relief** | Add: *“Nothing in this Agreement shall limit Sponsor’s right to seek injunctive or equitable relief to protect its trademarks, brand image, or exclusivity rights.”* |\n| **Governing Law / Jurisdiction** | Consider adding: *“For disputes involving brand misuse or exclusivity breaches, Sponsor may elect to litigate in federal court in [New York or Delaware], which offers faster resolution and brand-friendly precedent.”* |\n| **Approval Rights Expansion** | Strengthen Section 3(a)(iv): *“Sponsor’s approval rights extend to all visual, audio, and digital materials featuring Sponsor Marks, including social media posts, influencer content, and press releases.”* |\n\n> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Request inclusion of **co-branding guidelines** (font sizes, color palettes, placement hierarchy) in Exhibit A to ensure consistent brand presentation.\n\n---\n\n# 📌 **Summary of Critical Revisions Needed**\n\n| Priority | Clause | Issue | Recommended Fix |\n|----------|--------|-------|------------------|\n| 🔴 HIGH | Section 9 | No exclusivity | Replace with **Category Exclusivity + Competitor List + Remedies** |\n| 🔴 HIGH | Section 15 | No refund for FM | Add **refund trigger, timeline, insurance, MAC clause** |\n| 🟡 MEDIUM | Section 3 | Approval rights strong but no KPIs | Add **performance metrics + reporting + termination for underperformance** |\n| 🟡 MEDIUM | Section 16 | Arbitration only | Add **injunctive relief option + jurisdiction flexibility** |\n| 🟢 LOW | Sections 13, 20 | Assignment & authority | Already adequate — retain as-is |\n\n---\n\n# 📄 **Recommended Revised Clauses (Copy-Paste Ready)**\n\n### ➤ Replace Section 9 with:\n\n> **9. Exclusivity.**  \n> During the Term, Recipient shall grant Sponsor **exclusive sponsorship rights** in the category of “[Specify Category, e.g., Consumer Health Products]”. Recipient shall not accept sponsorship, co-branding, or promotional partnerships from any entity listed in **Exhibit C (Prohibited Competitors)**, nor from any entity operating in the same product/service category without Sponsor’s prior written consent. Sponsor shall have the right to audit all promotional materials, signage, digital assets, and third-party activations to ensure compliance. In the event of breach, Sponsor may demand removal of conflicting branding, receive a proportional refund, and/or terminate this Agreement with 15 days’ notice.\n\n---\n\n### ➤ Add New Section after 15:\n\n> **15.1 Refund & Insurance.**  \n> In the event of cancellation or material reduction in scope due to a Force Majeure Event (as defined in Section 15), Sponsor shall be entitled to a **full refund** of any unused sponsorship funds within **30 calendar days** of written notice of cancellation. Recipient shall maintain **event cancellation insurance** covering 100% of the sponsorship value, naming Sponsor as an additional insured or loss payee. Sponsor shall not be required to accept future credits or rescheduling as compensation.\n\n> **15.2 Material Adverse Change.**  \n> If the event’s scale, audience reach, or brand value is materially diminished (e.g., >30% reduction in attendance, cancellation of key speakers, or negative publicity), Sponsor may terminate this Agreement and receive a pro-rata refund of unspent funds.\n\n---\n\n### ➤ Add New Section after 16:\n\n> **16.1 Performance Metrics & Termination for Cause.**  \n> Recipient shall deliver monthly performance reports detailing KPIs including impressions, reach, sentiment, conversion, and social engagement attributable to Sponsor’s activation (as defined in **Exhibit D**). Failure to meet agreed KPIs for two consecutive months entitles Sponsor to terminate with 30 days’ notice and receive a pro-rata refund.  \n>   \n> Sponsor may terminate this Agreement immediately if: (i) Recipient engages in conduct that materially harms Sponsor’s reputation; (ii) Key speakers or talent involved in the event are embroiled in scandal; or (iii) Event is mismanaged to the point of public embarrassment.\n\n---\n\n# ✅ Final Recommendations\n\n1. **Insist on Category Exclusivity** — Non-negotiable for a sponsor of J&J’s caliber.\n2. **Demand Escrow Account** — Funds released upon event milestones or completion.\n3. **Require Event Cancellation Insurance** — With Sponsor as loss payee.\n4. **Define KPIs & Reporting** — Tie ROI to contractual obligations.\n5. **Add MAC Clause** — Protect against devaluation of sponsorship.\n6. **Preserve Approval Rights** — Expand to all digital/social/influencer content.\n7. **Retain Arbitration but Allow Injunctive Relief** — For urgent brand protection.\n\n---\n\n# 📎 Appendix: Suggested Exhibits to Attach\n\n- **Exhibit A**: Sponsor Marks + Usage Guidelines (already exists)\n- **Exhibit B**: Recipient Marks\n- **Exhibit C**: Prohibited Competitors (Dynamic List)\n- **Exhibit D**: KPIs, Reporting Schedule, and Thresholds\n- **Exhibit E**: Co-Branding Guidelines (Logo Placement, Colors, Fonts)\n\n---\n\n# 🧭 Strategic Takeaway\n\nThis agreement, as drafted, **heavily favors the Recipient** and exposes J&J to **significant financial, reputational, and competitive risks**. As a major global brand, J&J should leverage its market position to demand **stronger protections, clearer ROI mechanisms, and enforceable exclusivity**.\n\nWith these revisions, the Sponsor will not only **protect its capital** but also **enhance its brand equity, control narrative, and maximize ROI** — aligning perfectly with industry best practices in high-stakes brand marketing and sponsorship.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you’d like this formatted into a **redlined version**, **negotiation script**, or **checklist PDF** for internal legal review."

Meaning Interpretation（诗意解读）\n\n这首《将进酒》是盛唐诗人李白最具代表性的乐府诗之一，全篇以豪放不羁、纵情饮酒的口吻，抒发了人生短暂、及时行乐、自信洒脱与怀才不遇的复杂情感。\n\n### 核心意象与主题：\n\n- **“黄河之水天上来”**：开篇气势磅礴，以黄河奔流不息象征时间无情、生命易逝，暗含对人生短暂的感慨。\n- **“高堂明镜悲白发，朝如青丝暮成雪”**：极言时光飞逝，青春转瞬即老，充满对生命流逝的悲叹。\n- **“人生得意须尽欢，莫使金樽空对月”**：劝人及时行乐，享受当下，是对现实无奈的一种超脱态度。\n- **“天生我材必有用，千金散尽还复来”**：展现李白强烈的自我肯定与豪迈气概，即使落魄也不失自信。\n- **“钟鼓馔玉不足贵，但愿长醉不愿醒”**：批判富贵荣华，向往精神自由，宁愿沉醉于酒中逃避现实。\n- **“古来圣贤皆寂寞，惟有饮者留其名”**：借古讽今，表达对传统价值体系的质疑，认为唯有放浪形骸者方能留名。\n- **“五花马、千金裘，呼儿将出换美酒”**：不惜倾家荡产换酒，表现极度豪放与对友情、酒兴的珍视。\n- **“与尔同销万古愁”**：结尾点题，酒非仅为享乐，更是消解千古忧愁的精神寄托。\n\n> 全诗结构跌宕起伏，语言酣畅淋漓，情感由悲转喜、由喜转狂、再归于深沉，体现了李白“诗仙”的浪漫主义风格和强烈个性。\n\n---\n\n## 2. Poet’s Creative Background（创作背景）\n\n《将进酒》约作于唐玄宗天宝十一年（公元752年），时年李白51岁。此时他早已被赐金放还，离开长安，政治抱负受挫，游历四方，常与友人饮酒赋诗，排遣胸中块垒。\n\n- **政治失意**：李白曾供奉翰林，后因得罪权贵被逐出宫廷，理想破灭，内心苦闷。\n- **性格使然**：李白素以豪放不羁、狂放自适著称，常借酒浇愁，诗中“醉”与“狂”是他对抗现实的方式。\n- **友人相聚**：诗中提到“岑夫子，丹丘生”，即岑勋与元丹丘，均为李白好友。此诗应为宴席上即兴所作，边饮边歌，情绪激昂。\n\n> 李白在诗中虽表面豪饮狂欢，实则暗藏壮志未酬、世道不公的悲愤，是“以乐写哀”的典型。\n\n---\n\n## 3. Historical Context（历史背景）\n\n### 盛唐气象与文人精神：\n- 唐代开元、天宝年间，国力鼎盛，文化繁荣，士人多具豪情壮志，追求建功立业。\n- 但随着李林甫、杨国忠等奸臣当道，政治日益腐败，许多有才之士如李白一样被边缘化。\n\n### 酒文化盛行：\n- 唐代饮酒风气极盛，酒不仅是社交媒介，也是文人抒怀、寄情的重要载体。\n- “将进酒”本为汉乐府旧题，多用于劝酒歌，李白借此题发挥，赋予其全新内涵。\n\n### 社会价值观的冲突：\n- 诗中“钟鼓馔玉不足贵”、“古来圣贤皆寂寞”等句，挑战了儒家推崇的“立德立功立言”传统价值观。\n- 李白以“饮者留名”反讽圣贤寂寞，反映当时部分知识分子对仕途失望后的叛逆与疏离。\n\n> 此诗既是个人情感的宣泄，也是时代精神的缩影——盛唐的辉煌与危机并存，个体在宏大叙事中的孤独与挣扎。\n\n---\n\n## 结语\n\n《将进酒》不仅是一首劝酒诗，更是一曲生命的颂歌与悲歌。它融合了宇宙意识、人生哲思、豪情壮志与深沉悲凉，在李白笔下化为惊涛骇浪般的诗句，穿越千年仍震撼人心。正如清人沈德潜所评：“此篇纯以气胜，读之使人神旺。”\n\n> **“与尔同销万古愁”——这杯酒，敬的是时间，敬的是命运，敬的是所有不甘平庸的灵魂。**\n\n--- \n\n📌 *注：本诗亦收录于《全唐诗》卷165，是李白乐府诗中最富感染力的作品之一，历代传诵不衰。*",

    "llm_output_test3": "result: # 《梦游天姥吟留别》深度解析\n\n## 1. Meaning Interpretation\n\n这首诗是唐代大诗人李白的代表作之一，题为《梦游天姥吟留别》，实则是一首以“梦”为载体、借仙境抒发人生感慨与政治失意的浪漫主义长篇歌行。全诗可分为三大部分：\n\n---\n\n### **第一部分：引子 —— 瀛洲难求，天姥可睹**\n\n> 海客谈瀛洲，烟涛微茫信难求；  \n> 越人语天姥，云霞明灭或可睹。\n\n开篇以“海客谈瀛洲”起兴，瀛洲是传说中的海上仙山，虚无缥缈、难以寻觅；而“天姥山”虽非仙境，却因“云霞明灭”而显得神秘可亲。李白借此对比，暗示现实中的理想（如仕途功名）如瀛洲般遥不可及，而精神寄托（如山水自然、自由境界）则如天姥山般虽险峻却可触及。\n\n> 天姥连天向天横，势拔五岳掩赤城。  \n> 天台四万八千丈，对此欲倒东南倾。\n\n极言天姥山之高峻雄伟，甚至压倒五岳、使天台山俯首。此为夸张手法，实则是李白内心对超脱尘世、追求精神自由的渴望投射——他要攀登的不是物理高山，而是心灵的巅峰。\n\n---\n\n### **第二部分：梦境 —— 游仙奇境，魂魄震荡**\n\n> 我欲因之梦吴越，一夜飞度镜湖月……  \n> 青冥浩荡不见底，日月照耀金银台。  \n> 霓为衣兮风为马，云之君兮纷纷而来下。  \n> 虎鼓瑟兮鸾回车，仙之人兮列如麻。\n\n李白在梦中乘月飞渡，登临天姥，经历奇幻旅程：从谢灵运足迹到青云梯，从海日天鸡到熊咆龙吟，从云雨烟霭到雷电崩摧，最终进入“洞天石扉”开启的仙境——金银台、霓裳风马、仙人如麻。这是李白想象中最辉煌、最自由、最神圣的精神世界。\n\n> 忽魂悸以魄动，恍惊起而长嗟。  \n> 惟觉时之枕席，失向来之烟霞。\n\n梦境戛然而止，诗人惊醒，发现一切不过是枕席之间的幻影。“烟霞”象征理想与自由，“失向来之烟霞”即是对现实的无奈回归，也是对理想破灭的哀叹。\n\n---\n\n### **第三部分：醒悟 —— 人生如梦，宁折不屈**\n\n> 世间行乐亦如此，古来万事东流水。  \n> 别君去兮何时还？且放白鹿青崖间，须行即骑访名山。  \n> 安能摧眉折腰事权贵，使我不得开心颜？\n\n梦醒后的哲思：“世间行乐”如梦如幻，历史万事皆如东逝之水，转瞬即逝。面对现实，李白选择主动抽身——“放白鹿”、“访名山”，归隐山林，保持人格独立。最后一句“安能摧眉折腰事权贵”，是整首诗的灵魂所在，表达了他对权贵的蔑视和对自由人格的坚守，成为千古绝唱。\n\n---\n\n## 2. Poet’s Creative Background\n\n李白（701–762），字太白，号青莲居士，盛唐浪漫主义诗歌的巅峰代表。他一生怀才不遇，虽曾入长安供奉翰林，但因性格傲岸、不拘礼法，不久即被排挤出朝。本诗创作于公元744年（天宝三年），李白被唐玄宗“赐金放还”，离开长安后南游吴越途中所作。\n\n此时的李白，经历了政治上的挫败、理想的幻灭，但仍保留着豪迈不羁的个性。他通过“梦游天姥”这一虚构旅程，表达对现实的不满、对自由的向往、对权贵的不屑。这不仅是个人情绪的宣泄，更是盛唐知识分子精神困境的缩影。\n\n诗中提到“谢公宿处”，指东晋诗人谢灵运，他曾游历剡溪、登临天姥，李白借其足迹表达对魏晋风骨的追慕——崇尚自然、不媚权贵、追求个性解放。\n\n---\n\n## 3. Historical Context\n\n### 盛唐的辉煌与阴影\n\n李白生活于盛唐由盛转衰之际。开元年间（713–741）经济繁荣、文化昌盛，但至天宝年间（742–756），朝廷腐败、权臣当道（如李林甫、杨国忠），社会矛盾逐渐显现。李白作为“布衣卿相”的理想主义者，在宫廷中格格不入，最终被逐。\n\n### 士人的精神出路\n\n唐代士人普遍有“学而优则仕”的传统，但仕途并非唯一出路。尤其在盛唐后期，越来越多文人转向山水田园、道教神仙、佛教禅理，寻求精神解脱。李白正是其中最具代表性的人物。他的“游仙诗”不仅继承了六朝传统，更注入了强烈的自我意识与反抗精神。\n\n### 道教影响与游仙文化\n\n天姥山位于浙江新昌，自古被视为道教圣地，传说中有仙人往来。李白深受道教思想影响，常以“游仙”象征精神超越。本诗中“霓为衣兮风为马”、“虎鼓瑟兮鸾回车”等描写，直接借鉴《楚辞·九歌》与道教典籍，将神话意象与个人情感融为一体，开创了盛唐游仙诗的新境界。\n\n---\n\n## 结语\n\n《梦游天姥吟留别》不仅是李白个人政治失意后的心灵独白，更是盛唐知识分子精神觉醒的宣言。它以瑰丽的想象、奔放的语言、深刻的哲思，构建了一个超越现实的理想王国，并最终回归现实，发出“安能摧眉折腰事权贵”的千古呐喊。这首诗既是李白浪漫主义风格的集大成者，也是中国古典诗歌中“梦”与“醒”、“仙”与“俗”、“自由”与“束缚”主题的巅峰之作。\n\n> **“梦里不知身是客，一晌贪欢。”** —— 李白以梦为舟，载着理想远航，终在现实中泊岸，却仍昂首挺立，笑对苍穹。"

replace with custom font if needed).\n- **Rustic charm**: Sprinkles, uneven strokes, sticker-like border.\n\n---\n\n### 💡 Tips for Use:\n\n- **Font Replacement**: For true hand-drawn look, embed a custom font like “KG Primary Penmanship” or “Lemon Tuesday” using `@font-face` in CSS or convert text to paths.\n- **Add Texture**: Overlay a subtle watercolor or grain texture in post-processing for extra warmth.\n- **Responsive Scaling**: This SVG scales cleanly — perfect for websites, merch, or print.\n\nLet me know if you’d like a version with embedded fonts, animated elements, or alternative color schemes! 🥯☀️",

White is used sparingly for highlights and outlines — enhancing contrast without violating the palette.\n\n4. **Iconography**:  \n   - **Roaring bull silhouette** — muscular, fierce, embodies explosive power.\n   - **Shield + dumbbell fusion** — cleverly integrated into one symbol, representing protection and strength.\n   - Both icons are stylized to fit the tough, angular aesthetic.\n\n5. **Typography**:  \n   - Bold, sans-serif font with stroke + fill gradient + motion lines = *aggressive, fast, impactful* — exactly as requested.\n\n6. **Visual Effects**:  \n   - Red glow filter on bull and text adds intensity.\n   - Speed lines behind bull and under text simulate motion.\n   - Metallic gradient on shield implies texture without requiring shaders.\n\n7. **Scalability & Format**:  \n   - Pure SVG, vector-based, no raster elements — fully scalable for web, print, or apparel.\n   - Clean structure with `<defs>` for reusability and performance.\n\n8. **Additional Polish**:  \n   - Bottom chevron accent adds visual grounding and dynamism.\n   - Rivets, bolts, and teeth details enhance realism and toughness.\n\n---\n\n### 🛠️ Minor Suggestions (Optional Enhancements):\n\nWhile not required, here are optional refinements for future iterations:\n\n- **Add `preserveAspectRatio=\"xMidYMid meet\"`** to `<svg>` tag for better responsive behavior.\n- Consider adding `role=\"img\"` and `aria-label=\"Iron Core Gym Logo\"` for accessibility.\n- For animation, you could add CSS/SMIL animations to the bull’s roar or speed lines.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Verdict:\n\n> **No changes needed. The SVG is production-ready and fully aligned with the creative brief.**\n\n---\n\n### 📤 Output (Unchanged as Requested):\n\n```svg\n<svg width=\"800\" height=\"800\" viewBox=\"0 0 800 800\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <defs>\n    <!-- Red Glow Filter -->\n    <filter id=\"redGlow\" x=\"-50%\" y=\"-50%\" width=\"200%\" height=\"200%\">\n      <feGaussianBlur in=\"SourceAlpha\" stdDeviation=\"8\" result=\"blur\"/>\n      <feFlood flood-color=\"#ff0000\" flood-opacity=\"0.6\" result=\"glowColor\"/>\n      <feComposite in=\"glowColor\" in2=\"blur\" operator=\"in\" result=\"softGlow\"/>\n      <feMerge>\n        <feMergeNode in=\"softGlow\"/>\n        <feMergeNode in=\"SourceGraphic\"/>\n      </feMerge>\n    </filter>\n\n    <!-- Metallic Gradient for Shield -->\n    <linearGradient id=\"metalGradient\" x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"1\" y2=\"1\">\n      <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#ffffff\" stop-opacity=\"0.7\"/>\n      <stop offset=\"50%\" stop-color=\"#aaaaaa\"/>\n      <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#555555\"/>\n    </linearGradient>\n\n    <!-- Text Gradient: White to Red -->\n    <linearGradient id=\"textGradient\" x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"0\" y2=\"1\">\n      <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#ffffff\"/>\n      <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#cc0000\"/>\n    </linearGradient>\n  </defs>\n\n  <!-- Background -->\n  <rect width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" fill=\"#111111\"/>\n\n  <!-- Speed Lines Behind Bull -->\n  <g opacity=\"0.7\">\n    <path d=\"M100 300 L200 320 L180 340 L120 330 Z\" fill=\"#cc0000\" transform=\"rotate(-15 150 320)\"/>\n    <path d=\"M90 330 L190 350 L170 370 L110 360 Z\" fill=\"#cc0000\" transform=\"rotate(-20 140 350)\"/>\n    <path d=\"M80 360 L180 380 L160 400 L100 390 Z\" fill=\"#cc0000\" transform=\"rotate(-25 130 380)\"/>\n  </g>\n\n  <!-- Roaring Bull Silhouette -->\n  <g filter=\"url(#redGlow)\">\n    <!-- Body -->\n    <path d=\"M220 400 C240 380 260 370 280 380 C300 390 320 410 340 400 C360 390 380 370 400 380 C420 390 440 410 460 400 C480 390 500 370 520 380 C540 390 560 410 580 400 C600 390 620 370 640 380 C660 390 680 410 700 400\" fill=\"#000000\" stroke=\"#ffffff\" stroke-width=\"2\"/>\n\n    <!-- Head & Horns -->\n    <path d=\"M500 300 C520 280 540 270 560 280 C580 290 600 310 620 300 C640 290 660 270 680 280 C700 290 720 310 740 300\" fill=\"#000000\" stroke=\"#ffffff\" stroke-width=\"2\"/>\n    <path d=\"M520 260 Q540 240 560 250\" stroke=\"#ffffff\" stroke-width=\"4\" fill=\"none\"/>\n    <path d=\"M680 260 Q660 240 640 250\" stroke=\"#ffffff\" stroke-width=\"4\" fill=\"none\"/>\n\n    <!-- Eyes -->\n    <circle cx=\"600\" cy=\"290\" r=\"6\" fill=\"#ff0000\"/>\n    <circle cx=\"620\" cy=\"290\" r=\"6\" fill=\"#ff0000\"/>\n\n    <!-- Mouth & Teeth -->\n    <path d=\"M580 310 Q600 330 620 310\" stroke=\"#ffffff\" stroke-width=\"3\" fill=\"none\"/>\n    <path d=\"M590 315 L595 320 L600 315\" stroke=\"#ffffff\" stroke-width=\"2\" fill=\"none\"/>\n    <path d=\"M610 315 L605 320 L600 315\" stroke=\"#ffffff\" stroke-width=\"2\" fill=\"none\"/>\n  </g>\n\n  <!-- Shield + Dumbbell Fusion -->\n  <g transform=\"translate(400, 400)\">\n    <!-- Shield Base -->\n    <path d=\"M-60 -40 L60 -40 L40 40 L-40 40 Z\" fill=\"url(#metalGradient)\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"3\"/>\n    <!-- Rivets -->\n    <circle cx=\"-50\" cy=\"-30\" r=\"2\" fill=\"#ffffff\"/>\n    <circle cx=\"50\" cy=\"-30\" r=\"2\" fill=\"#ffffff\"/>\n    <circle cx=\"-50\" cy=\"30\" r=\"2\" fill=\"#ffffff\"/>\n    <circle cx=\"50\" cy=\"30\" r=\"2\" fill=\"#ffffff\"/>\n    <!-- Dumbbell Handle -->\n    <rect x=\"-20\" y=\"10\" width=\"40\" height=\"10\" rx=\"5\" fill=\"#333333\"/>\n    <!-- Dumbbell Plates -->\n    <circle cx=\"-30\" cy=\"15\" r=\"15\" fill=\"#444444\"/>\n    <circle cx=\"30\" cy=\"15\" r=\"15\" fill=\"#444444\"/>\n    <!-- Central Bolt -->\n    <circle cx=\"0\" cy=\"15\" r=\"3\" fill=\"#ffffff\"/>\n  </g>\n\n  <!-- Text: IRON CORE -->\n  <g transform=\"translate(400, 550)\">\n    <!-- Text Outline -->\n    <text x=\"0\" y=\"0\" font-family=\"Impact, Arial Black, sans-serif\" font-size=\"80\" font-weight=\"bold\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#cc0000\" stroke-width=\"6\" filter=\"url(#redGlow)\">IRON CORE</text>\n    <!-- Text Fill -->\n    <text x=\"0\" y=\"0\" font-family=\"Impact, Arial Black, sans-serif\" font-size=\"80\" font-weight=\"bold\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"url(#textGradient)\">IRON CORE</text>\n    <!-- Motion Blur Effect (Speed Lines Under Text) -->\n    <path d=\"M-200 30 L-150 25 L-100 30 L-50 25 L0 30 L50 25 L100 30 L150 25 L200 30\" stroke=\"#cc0000\" stroke-width=\"4\" fill=\"none\" opacity=\"0.6\"/>\n  </g>\n\n  <!-- Bottom Chevron Accent -->\n  <path d=\"M300 600 L400 550 L500 600\" stroke=\"#cc0000\" stroke-width=\"8\" fill=\"none\" stroke-linecap=\"round\"/>\n\n</svg>\n```\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you’d like variants (animated, transparent bg, white-on-black, etc.) — I’m ready to generate them! 💪🏋️‍♂️",

To build a remote that people *want* to hold, *love* to use, and maybe even *show off*.\n\nTo win, we must:\n✅ Be original  \n✅ Be trendy  \n✅ Be intuitive  \n✅ Be durable — and yes, maybe even waterproof 😄  \n✅ And above all — solve real user pain points.\n\nFinancially, we’re targeting:\n- **Production cost under €12.50**\n- **Selling price at ~€25**\n- **Goal: €50M profit** across the product lifecycle\n\nThat’s ambitious — but achievable if we nail the design and user experience.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Design Process: Three Key Phases\n\nWe’ve broken the design journey into three clear phases:\n\n### 1. Functional Design\n→ What does this remote *need* to do?  \n→ Which devices will it control? (Single? Multi-device?)  \n→ What core functions are non-negotiable?\n\n### 2. Conceptual Design\n→ How will users interact with it?  \n→ Buttons? Touch? Voice? Gestures?  \n→ What trends are shaping UI/UX today?  \n→ How can we make it feel modern, not boxy?\n\n### 3. Desired Design\n→ Final form, materials, ergonomics, lighting, durability  \n→ How does it look, feel, and function in real life?  \n→ Can it survive drops? Spills? Bath time? (Yes, seriously.)\n\n---\n\n## 🐒 Creative Warm-Up: “Draw Your Favorite Animal”\n\nI know — this sounds random. But hear me out.\n\nThis wasn’t just about drawing orangutans or cats named “Caramel” (yes, we had both 😉). It was about unlocking creativity. About thinking differently. About breaking patterns.\n\nBecause innovation doesn’t come from spreadsheets alone — it comes from play, imagination, and letting your mind wander before you focus.\n\nSo thank you for playing along — and for giving us a glimpse into your creative brains.\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Key Ideas & Decisions So Far\n\nHere’s what we’ve agreed on — and where we need to go next:\n\n### 🔹 Multi-Device vs Single Device?\n> **Consensus:** It should be programmable — capable of controlling multiple devices.  \n> *Why?* Because standalone remotes are dying. People want one device to rule them all.\n\n### 🔹 Minimalist Interface\n> Fewer buttons = cleaner design = better UX.  \n> Let’s avoid clutter. Think Apple TV remote — elegant, simple, powerful.\n\n### 🔹 Ergonomics & Form\n> Must fit comfortably in hand.  \n> Avoid square boxes — think curves, soft edges, natural grip.  \n> Bonus: Backlit buttons for low-light use.\n\n### 🔹 Durability & Innovation\n> Shock-resistant? Yes.  \n> Waterproof? Potentially — yes.  \n> *Imagine using it in the bath.* That’s a differentiator no one else has.  \n> *(Note: We may offer waterproofing as an optional add-on to manage cost.)*\n\n### 🔹 Smart Features: “Whistle Tracking”\n> Here’s the fun part — what if you could whistle (or bark 😆) to make the remote beep and reveal its location?  \n> Yes, it adds cost — but it solves a real problem: *“Where did I put my remote?!”*  \n> Let’s explore feasibility — Industrial Designer, this is yours to investigate.\n\n---\n\n## 📅 Next Steps & Assignments\n\n### ➤ Industrial Designer:\nResearch and prototype the “whistle tracking” feature. Also, explore materials, shape, and durability options. Bring sketches and cost estimates to our next meeting.\n\n### ➤ User Interface Designer:\nFocus on button layout, backlighting, touch sensitivity, and overall usability. Think: how can we reduce friction between user and device?\n\n### ➤ Marketing Expert:\nIdentify absolute user requirements. What features are *must-haves*? What’s the competition missing? What would make someone buy ours over theirs?\n\n---\n\n## ⏳ Timeline & Communication\n\nOur next check-in is in **30 minutes** — but don’t panic! You’ll also receive a detailed email with action items, deadlines, and inspiration resources.\n\nPlease review your assignments and start brainstorming. We’re building something special — let’s make it unforgettable.\n\n---\n\n## 🙌 Closing\n\nThank you all for your energy, your ideas, and your willingness to think outside the box — or in this case, outside the remote.\n\nLet’s not just design a remote. Let’s design an *experience*. One that delights, surprises, and sticks in people’s hands — and hearts.\n\nSee you in 30 — and remember: if you lose your remote, just whistle. 😊\n\n---\n\n**End of Speech**\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you’d like this adapted for a presentation slide deck, investor pitch, or internal memo format!",

Below is a **polished, professional speech draft** that captures the spirit, key decisions, and outcomes of the meeting — while transforming the informal, fragmented dialogue into a clear, engaging, and cohesive presentation suitable for stakeholders, executives, or team retrospectives.\n\n---\n\n# 🍌 **Speech Draft: “Project Banana” – Design Review & Go/No-Go Decision**\n\n**Delivered by: Project Manager**\n\n---\n\nGood afternoon, everyone,\n\nToday marks a pivotal moment in our journey — not just as a product team, but as innovators who dare to think differently. We gathered to evaluate a prototype that’s… well, let’s be honest — it looks like a banana. And not just any banana — *the essence of bananas*. (Yes, we heard that from our UI designer, and we’re not arguing.)\n\nBut beyond its charming外形 — yes, it’s shaped like a banana, wrapped in spongy rubber, complete with wheels — this isn’t just whimsy. This is strategy. This is innovation wrapped in playful design. And today, we’ve confirmed: **it works.**\n\nLet me walk you through how we got here — and why we’re ready to move forward.\n\n---\n\n## 💰 Financial Viability: Under Budget, Over Promise\n\nWe began with cost analysis — because no matter how delightful a product is, if it doesn’t make business sense, it stays on the drawing board.\n\nOur target? Keep production under €12.50.  \nOur result? **€10.70 per unit.**\n\nThat’s not just under budget — it’s *significantly* under. With a retail price point projected at €25, we’re looking at healthy margins — even before factoring in the premium people are willing to pay for something that’s both functional *and* fun.\n\nAnd yes — we compared it to legacy banana-shaped phones that sold for €100–€200. Ours does less, sure — but it’s not trying to be a phone. It’s a remote. A companion. A conversation starter. And at €25? It’s irresistible.\n\n---\n\n## 📊 Evaluation: The Six Pillars of Success\n\nNext, we evaluated the prototype against six critical criteria — derived from user needs and market trends:\n\n1. **Fancy Look & Feel** → Average: **5.5/7**  \n   *“It’s beautiful.”*  \n   The form factor, texture, and color earned high praise — especially for standing out in a sea of black rectangles.\n\n2. **Technological Innovation** → Average: **4/7**  \n   *“The wheel is clever. The rubber? Nice touch.”*  \n   Not revolutionary, but thoughtfully integrated — and enough to differentiate us in a crowded space.\n\n3. **Ease of Use** → Average: **6.5/7**  \n   *“Intuitive. Almost too simple.”*  \n   Everyone agreed — it’s effortless to pick up and operate. No manuals needed.\n\n4. **Fashion / Trend Alignment** → Average: **7/7**  \n   *“It’s a fruit. Of course it’s fashionable.”*  \n   The banana shape taps into nostalgia, humor, and visual pop — perfect for Gen Z and millennial markets.\n\n5. **Easy to Find in a Room** → Average: **6.5/7**  \n   *“I lost my banana.”*  \n   (Said with a laugh — but seriously, bright yellow + unique shape = impossible to misplace.)\n\n6. **Robustness** → Average: **6/7**  \n   *“Rubber casing = drop-proof vibes.”*  \n   While sensitive components may need shielding, the outer shell gives peace of mind — especially for households with kids or clumsy partners.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Final Verdict: Green Light!\n\nAdding it all up — financially viable, emotionally appealing, functionally sound — we have a winner.\n\n**Average Score: 6/7 — solidly “good,” trending toward “excellent.”**\n\nThis isn’t just a product. It’s a statement: that design can be joyful without sacrificing utility. That affordability doesn’t mean compromise. That sometimes, the best ideas come from asking, *“What if it looked like a banana?”*\n\n---\n\n## 🥂 Next Steps: Celebrate. Then Scale.\n\nSo — what’s next?\n\n✅ **Approve prototype for pilot production**  \n✅ **Begin market testing in Q3**  \n✅ **Finalize packaging and branding (yes, we’re calling it “Banana Remote” — unless someone has a better name?)**  \n✅ **Start planning for Phase 2 — maybe a pineapple version? Or a kiwi? Let’s keep the fruit theme going.**\n\nAnd yes — we’ll open the champagne. (Or at least order some actual bananas for the office.)\n\nTo our Industrial Designer and User Interface team — thank you. You turned a silly idea into something brilliant. To Marketing — your evaluation was sharp, fair, and insightful. To everyone else — your collaboration made this possible.\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Final Thought\n\nInnovation doesn’t always come from complex algorithms or bleeding-edge tech. Sometimes, it comes from asking, *“What if it felt like holding a banana?”*\n\nAnd when that question leads to a product that’s affordable, usable, memorable, and profitable — you know you’ve struck gold.\n\nOr should I say… *yellow.*\n\nThank you, team. Let’s go build the future — one banana-shaped remote at a time.\n\n---\n\n**End of Speech**\n\n---\n\n> *Optional closing line for internal use:*  \n> “P.S. If management asks why we spent $10K on banana prototypes — tell them it was an investment in joy. And ROI.”\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you’d like to tailor this for investors, executives, or a public launch event — I can adjust tone, depth, or emphasis accordingly!"

    "llm_output_test3": "summary: <background>\nLes modèles de langage à grande échelle (LLMs) sont généralement considérés comme nécessitant d’énormes quantités de données d’entraînement pour développer des capacités de raisonnement complexes, notamment en mathématiques. Cette hypothèse repose sur l’idée que le raisonnement exige des démonstrations supervisées massives et que les méthodes d’ajustement fin (SFT) conduisent principalement à la mémorisation plutôt qu’à la généralisation. Cependant, les progrès récents dans la pré-formation des LLMs — qui intègrent désormais une quantité sans précédent de connaissances mathématiques — et dans les techniques d’inférence (comme les chaînes de raisonnement prolongées) suggèrent qu’un paradigme plus efficace pourrait être possible.\n</background>\n\n<objectifs>\nL’objectif de ce travail est de remettre en question l’hypothèse selon laquelle un volume massif de données est indispensable pour induire un raisonnement sophistiqué chez les LLMs. Les auteurs proposent l’**Hypothèse LIMO (Less Is More for Reasoning)** : dans les modèles fondamentaux dont la base de connaissances a été enrichie pendant la pré-formation, un raisonnement complexe peut émerger grâce à un nombre minimal d’exemples stratégiquement conçus pour guider le processus cognitif. L’étude vise à valider cette hypothèse en construisant un petit jeu de données de haute qualité (800 exemples) et en montrant que des performances compétitives peuvent être atteintes avec très peu de données.\n</objectifs>\n\n<methods>\n1. **Construction du jeu de données LIMO** :\n   - À partir d’un pool initial de millions de problèmes mathématiques, les auteurs appliquent un filtrage multi-niveaux basé sur la difficulté (évaluée par des modèles de raisonnement), la diversité des points de connaissance et la cohérence des chaînes de raisonnement.\n   - Une notation règlementaire évalue quatre critères clés des chaînes de raisonnement : exploration détaillée, auto-vérification, approche exploratoire et granularité adaptative.\n   - Le jeu final comprend 800 paires question-réponse avec des chaînes de raisonnement de haute qualité.\n\n2. **Entraînement** :\n   - Le modèle de base utilisé est Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct.\n   - Un ajustement fin supervisé (SFT) est effectué sur les 800 exemples, avec optimisation DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 et FlashAttention-2.\n   - 15 époques, taux d’apprentissage de 5.0e-6, sans phase de démarrage progressif.\n\n3. **Évaluation** :\n   - Tests en domaine (AIME24, MATH500, AMC23) et hors domaine (OlympiadBench, CHMath, Gaokao, Minerva, GPQA).\n   - Métrique : pass@1 en mode zero-shot avec chaîne de pensée.\n   - Comparaisons avec des modèles d’état de l’art (OpenAI-o1-preview, QwQ-32B) et des versions entraînées sur des jeux de données beaucoup plus volumineux (OpenThoughts-114k, NuminaMath-100k).\n\n4. **Analyses ablatives** :\n   - Impact de la qualité des chaînes de raisonnement (5 niveaux de qualité).\n   - Impact de la difficulté des questions (Simple-500, Complex-500, Advanced-500).\n   - Influence de la base de connaissances pré-entraînée (comparaison entre Qwen1.5 et Qwen2.5).\n   - Étude de l’effet de la taille du modèle (3B à 72B).\n   - Analyse de l’efficacité des échantillons (400 à 2000 exemples).\n</methods>\n\n<findings>\n- **Performance exceptionnelle avec peu de données** : LIMO atteint 63,3 % sur AIME24 et 95,6 % sur MATH500, surpassant tous les modèles SFT précédents tout en utilisant seulement 1 % des données d’entraînement.\n- **Généralisation hors domaine remarquable** : LIMO obtient des gains absolus de 45,8 % sur des benchmarks variés, surpassant des modèles entraînés sur 100 fois plus de données.\n- **Validation de l’hypothèse LIMO** :\n  - La qualité des chaînes de raisonnement est cruciale : les modèles entraînés sur des chaînes de niveau L5 (haute qualité) surpassent nettement ceux entraînés sur des chaînes de niveau L1.\n  - La difficulté des questions améliore le raisonnement : un modèle entraîné sur des problèmes avancés (Advanced-500) atteint 91,2 % sur MATH500 sans données spécifiques.\n  - La base de connaissances pré-entraînée est déterminante : Qwen2.5 (avec meilleure pré-formation mathématique) permet à LIMO d’atteindre 63,3 % sur AIME24 contre 9,2 % pour Qwen1.5.\n  - Taille du modèle : les performances augmentent avec la taille, mais avec des rendements décroissants au-delà de 32B.\n  - Efficacité des échantillons : 800 exemples suffisent pour atteindre des performances quasi-optimales ; 400 exemples donnent déjà des gains spectaculaires (de 16,5 % à 57,5 % sur AIME24).\n- **Avantage par rapport aux grands jeux de données** : Les jeux comme NuminaMath-100k ou OpenThoughts-114k sous-performent LIMO, car leur contenu non ciblé nuit à la généralisation.\n</findings>\n\n<implications>\nCe travail démontre que **la qualité prime sur la quantité** pour activer le raisonnement complexe dans les LLMs. Il introduit un nouveau paradigme : plutôt que de chercher à augmenter les volumes de données, il faut concevoir des exemples qui servent de “modèles cognitifs” pour guider l’utilisation des connaissances pré-entraînées. L’Hypothèse LIMO offre une voie prometteuse vers des systèmes de raisonnement plus efficaces, moins coûteux en ressources et mieux généralisables.

Les auteurs démontrent que, grâce à un fine-tuning supervisé minimal mais stratégiquement conçu, leur modèle **LIMO** atteint des performances remarquables sur des benchmarks mathématiques exigeants — notamment **63,3 % sur AIME24** et **95,6 % sur MATH500** — tout en n’utilisant que **1 % des données d’entraînement** requises par les approches précédentes.\n\nLe cœur de leur contribution est l’**Hypothèse LIMO (Less-Is-More Reasoning)** : dans les modèles fondationnels dont la base de connaissances a été solidement encodée durant la pré-entraîne, un raisonnement sophistiqué peut émerger à partir d’un petit nombre d’exemples bien choisis, qui servent de “modèles cognitifs” guidant le processus de raisonnement. Deux facteurs clés déterminent cette capacité :  \n1. La richesse et la complétude des connaissances latentes du modèle ;  \n2. La qualité des chaînes de raisonnement fournies pendant l’entraînement, qui doivent être explicites, logiques et détaillées.\n\nPour valider cette hypothèse, les auteurs ont construit un jeu de données **LIMO** composé de seulement **800 exemples**, soigneusement sélectionnés à partir d’un pool initial de millions de problèmes mathématiques. Leur processus de curation repose sur :\n- Un filtrage multi-niveaux pour identifier les problèmes les plus difficiles et diversifiés ;\n- Une évaluation rigoureuse des chaînes de raisonnement selon quatre critères : développement exhaustif, auto-vérification, approche exploratoire et granularité adaptative.\n\nEn fine-tuning le modèle **Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct** avec ce jeu de données réduit, LIMO dépasse non seulement les modèles entraînés sur des jeux de données 100 fois plus volumineux (comme NuminaMath-100k ou OpenThoughts-114k), mais montre aussi une **généralisation hors distribution exceptionnelle** — avec une amélioration absolue de **45,8 %** sur des benchmarks variés, y compris en chinois (CHMath, Gaokao) et en sciences (Minerva, GPQA).\n\nLes analyses menées confirment que :\n- La **qualité des chaînes de raisonnement** a un impact direct sur les performances (les solutions les mieux notées donnent les meilleurs résultats) ;\n- La **difficulté des questions** entraîne une amélioration significative du raisonnement, même sans données spécifiques au benchmark cible ;\n- La **qualité des connaissances pré-entraînées** est essentielle : LIMO basé sur Qwen2.5 (avec des données mathématiques enrichies) surpasse nettement une version basée sur Qwen1.5 ;\n- La **taille du modèle** influence les performances, mais avec des rendements décroissants au-delà de 32B de paramètres ;\n- Seulement **400 à 800 échantillons** suffisent pour obtenir des gains substantiels, avec un rendement marginal au-delà.\n\nEn conclusion, LIMO prouve qu’une approche centrée sur la **qualité plutôt que la quantité** des données d’entraînement permet d’activer efficacement les capacités de raisonnement latentes des LLMs, ouvrant la voie à des méthodes plus efficaces et moins coûteuses pour enseigner le raisonnement aux modèles linguistiques.\n</résumé>\nmethodology_analysis: ```xml\n<methodology_analysis>\n  <title>Analyse méthodologique de LIMO : « Less is More for Reasoning »</title>\n\n  <innovative_aspects>\n    <aspect>\n      <label>Hypothèse LIMO</label>\n      <description>Le papier propose une hypothèse novatrice : la capacité à raisonner émerge non pas de la quantité de données, mais de la qualité des démonstrations cognitives fournies pendant l’ajustement fin.

    "llm_output_test1": "summary: <summary>\n这篇论文提出了一种名为LLaDA（Large Language Diffusion with mAsking）的新型大语言模型，它并非基于传统的自回归模型（ARM），而是采用扩散模型（Diffusion Model）架构从零开始训练。作者挑战了“大语言模型的核心能力必须依赖自回归建模”的主流观点，证明扩散模型同样能实现强大的可扩展性、上下文学习和指令跟随能力。\n\nLLaDA的核心机制包括两个过程：前向数据掩码过程（随机掩盖输入序列中的token）和反向生成过程（通过Transformer结构预测被掩盖的token）。该模型通过优化似然下界进行训练，从而提供一种基于概率推断的生成方法。在多个基准测试中（涵盖通用任务、数学、代码、中文等），LLaDA展现出与自回归基线模型相当甚至更优的表现。例如，8B参数的LLaDA在零样本/少样本任务上表现优于LLaMA2 7B，并与LLaMA3 8B持平；在经过监督微调后，其多轮对话能力和指令遵循能力显著提升。\n\n特别值得注意的是，LLaDA有效克服了“反转诅咒”（reversal curse）问题——即传统自回归模型难以处理逆向推理任务（如诗句倒序补全）。实验表明，LLaDA在反转诗歌完成任务中表现优于GPT-4o，这得益于其双向建模能力。\n\n研究还探讨了不同采样策略对性能的影响，发现纯扩散采样效果最佳。此外，LLaDA支持灵活的采样方式（如自回归或块扩散采样），无需额外训练即可适配多种生成模式。尽管当前版本未引入强化学习对齐或KV缓存等系统级优化，但其性能已极具竞争力。\n\n作者强调，这项工作不仅验证了扩散模型在大规模语言建模中的潜力，也揭示了大语言模型核心能力的本质可能源于生成建模原理本身，而非特定于自回归结构。未来工作将聚焦于扩大模型规模、探索多模态能力、引入RL对齐以及开发更高效的采样算法。\n\n项目主页与代码已开源：https://ml-gsai.github.io/LLaDA-demo/\n</summary>\nmethodology_analysis:

    "llm_output_test3": "summary: **Résumé en français :**\n\nDans cet article présenté à la conférence COLM 2025, les auteurs introduisent **LIMO (Less is More for Reasoning)**, un nouveau paradigme qui remet en question l’idée largement acceptée selon laquelle l’apprentissage du raisonnement complexe dans les grands modèles linguistiques (LLMs) nécessite des volumes massifs de données d’entraînement. Ils démontrent que, grâce à un affinement supervisé minimal mais stratégiquement conçu, leur modèle LIMO atteint des performances exceptionnelles sur des benchmarks mathématiques exigeants — notamment **63,3 % sur AIME24** et **95,6 % sur MATH500** — tout en n’utilisant que **1 % des données** requises par les approches précédentes.\n\nLe cœur de leur contribution est l’**Hypothèse LIMO** : dans les modèles fondationnels dont la base de connaissances a été richement encodée pendant la pré-formation, un raisonnement sophistiqué peut émerger à partir de très peu d’exemples, à condition qu’ils soient sélectionnés avec soin pour servir de « templates cognitifs » guidant le processus de raisonnement. Deux facteurs clés déterminent cette efficacité :\n1. La **richesse des connaissances latentes** déjà présentes dans le modèle.\n2. La **qualité des chaînes de raisonnement** fournies pendant l’affinement, qui doivent être détaillées, logiques et explicites.\n\nPour valider cette hypothèse, les auteurs ont construit un jeu de données extrêmement restreint (800 exemples) appelé **LIMO Dataset**, issu d’un processus rigoureux de curation. Ce processus inclut :\n- Un filtrage multi-niveaux des questions selon leur difficulté (en utilisant des modèles comme Qwen2.5-Math-7B et DeepSeek-R1).\n- Une sélection des chaînes de raisonnement les plus qualitatives, basée sur des critères objectifs : développement exhaustif, auto-vérification, approche exploratoire et granularité adaptative.\n\nEn fine-tuning le modèle Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct avec ce seul petit jeu de données, LIMO dépasse non seulement les modèles affinés sur des jeux de données 100 fois plus volumineux (comme NuminaMath-100k ou OpenThoughts-114k), mais montre également une **généralisation hors distribution remarquable** sur des benchmarks variés, y compris en chinois (CHMath, Gaokao) et multidisciplinaires (Minerva, GPQA).\n\nLes analyses approfondies révèlent que :\n- La **qualité des chaînes de raisonnement** a un impact direct sur les performances.\n- La **difficulté des questions** entraîne des gains significatifs en généralisation.\n- Le **choix du modèle de base** (pré-entraîné) est crucial : LIMO sur Qwen2.5 (avec un meilleur pré-entraînement mathématique) surpasse largement sa version sur Qwen1.5.\n- La **taille du modèle** influence les performances, mais avec des rendements décroissants au-delà de 32B de paramètres.\n- **800 exemples suffisent** pour atteindre des performances compétitives, avec des gains marginaux au-delà.\n\nEn conclusion, LIMO prouve qu’il est possible d’activer des capacités de raisonnement complexes dans les LLMs avec une quantité minimale de données — à condition que celles-ci soient hautement pertinentes et bien structurées. Cette découverte ouvre la voie à des méthodes d’entraînement beaucoup plus efficaces, économiques et écologiques, tout en améliorant la robustesse et la généralisation des modèles.\n\nLes auteurs publient leurs modèles, code et jeux de données pour encourager la recherche future sur le raisonnement efficace en termes de données.\nmethodology_analysis: ```xml\n<methodology_analysis>\n  <language>fr</language>\n  <paper_title>LIMO: Less is More for Reasoning</paper_title>\n  <conference>COLM 2025</conference>\n\n  <innovative_aspects>\n    <aspect>\n      <title>Hypothèse LIMO</title>\n      <description>\n        Le papier introduit l’hypothèse \"Less-Is-More Reasoning\" (LIMO), qui postule que des raisonnements complexes peuvent émerger dans les modèles de langage fondamentaux grâce à un nombre minimal d’exemples bien choisis, à condition que le modèle dispose déjà d’une base de connaissances riche acquise lors de la pré-entraînement.

The instruction specifies that the workflow should answer questions based on the content of a paper, and the output should be the answer. The provided output (answer) is detailed and directly addresses the question about how various social phenomena manifest in different types of communities. It systematically breaks down the manifestations of user retention, acculturation gap, and content affinity based on the distinctiveness and dynamicity of communities, which is consistent with the reference answer's focus on dynamicity and distinctiveness affecting user retention. The output's content and format satisfy the instruction, and it reasonably fulfills the intent of the query. The reference_answer, while not identical in structure, supports the semantic correctness of the output.\n",
    "llm_output_test2": "answer: Based on the paper, the various social phenomena examined (specifically user retention, acculturation gap, and content affinity) manifest in systematically different ways across different types of communities, as defined by the typology based on **distinctiveness** (how niche/specialized a community's interests are) and **dynamicity** (how rapidly its interests change over time).\n\nHere's how they manifest:\n\n1.  **User Retention:**\n    *   **Dynamicity is Key:** Communities that are highly **dynamic** (constantly updating content) show significantly higher rates of both short-term (monthly) and long-term user retention. This suggests users are more likely to stay if the content is continually refreshed.\n    *   **Distinctiveness has Limited Effect:** While **distinctive** (niche) communities show moderately higher *short-term* monthly retention, this effect does not translate to *long-term* retention. Highly distinctive communities can generate focused interest initially but struggle to retain users unless they also have dynamic content.\n\n2.  **Acculturation Gap (Linguistic Differentiation between Established Users and Newcomers):**\n    *   **Distinctiveness Increases the Gap:** The linguistic gap between established users and newcomers is significantly larger in **distinctive** communities. Established users in these niche communities use language that is much more aligned with the community's specific norms than newcomers do.\n    *   **Dynamicity has a Non-Linear Effect:** The gap is also large in communities that are either very **stable** (consistent content) or very **dynamic** (rapidly changing content). Stable communities have consistent, specialized language that newcomers struggle to adopt. Very dynamic communities might require more effort or attention from active users to keep up with trends, creating a barrier for newcomers who haven't invested the same level of engagement. Generic and moderately dynamic communities (like IAmA) show little to no acculturation gap.\n\n3.  **Content Affinity (Engagement with Specific vs. Volatile Content):**\n    *   **Distinctiveness Mediates the Divide:** The nature of the divide between active users and outsiders in terms of what content they engage with depends heavily on the community's distinctiveness.\n        *   In **distinctive** communities, active users show a stronger affinity for *both* community-specific content and temporally volatile content compared to outsiders.\n        *   In **generic** communities, the pattern reverses: it is often the *outsiders* who engage more with volatile content. This suggests volatile content in generic communities might act as an entry point for newcomers, attracting them initially, but not necessarily fostering long-term commitment.\n\nIn summary, the paper demonstrates that the characteristics of a community's collective identity (its distinctiveness and dynamicity) systematically shape how key social phenomena like user retention, newcomer integration (acculturation), and content engagement play out within that community. These patterns are not random but are predictable based on the community's position in the typology landscape.",

Eine schüchterne kleine Maus stieß unerwartet auf ihn und huschte in ihrer Angst und Eile, wegzukommen, ihm über die Nase. Der Löwe, aus seinem Schlaf gerissen, drückte wütend seine riesige Pfote auf das winzige Tier, um es zu töten.\n\n„Verschone mich!“, flehte die arme Maus. „Bitte lass mich gehen — eines Tages werde ich dir das sicher vergelten.“\n\nDer Löwe amüsierte sich über den Gedanken, eine Maus könne ihm jemals helfen. Doch er war großzügig und ließ die Maus schließlich gehen.\n\nEinige Tage später, während er im Wald leise seiner Beute nachstellte, geriet der Löwe in die Maschen eines Jägernetzes. Da er sich nicht befreien konnte, erfüllte sein wütendes Brüllen den ganzen Wald. Die Maus erkannte die Stimme und fand schnell den Löwen, der im Netz kämpfte. Sie rannte zu einem der massiven Seile, die ihn gefesselt hielten, nagte daran, bis es zerriss — und bald war der Löwe frei.\n\n„Du hast gelacht, als ich sagte, ich würde dir eines Tages das vergelten“, sagte die Maus. „Jetzt siehst du, dass sogar eine Maus einem Löwen helfen kann.“\n\n**Keine Güte geht verloren.**\n\n---\n\n### Verständnisfragen:\n\n**Warum glaubt der Löwe, die Maus könne ihn nicht vergelten?**  \n*(Weil er sich über die Vorstellung amüsiert, ein so kleines, schwaches Tier könnte ihm je nützlich sein.)*\n\n**Was ist eine Fabel?**  \nEine Fabel ist eine kurze Geschichte, in der normalerweise zwei Hauptfiguren auftreten. In diesem Fall sind die Hauptfiguren **der Löwe** und **die Maus**. In einer Fabel verhalten sich die Figuren wie Menschen in ihren Gedanken, Worten und Handlungen. In jeder Fabel steckt immer eine Lehre.  \n\n**Was ist hier die Lehre? Beschreibe sie mit eigenen Worten.**  \n*(Jede gute Tat, egal wie klein oder unbedeutend sie scheint, kann sich irgendwann auszahlen. Man sollte niemanden unterschätzen — auch der Kleinste kann Großes bewirken.)*\n\n---\n\n## 📌 Zusammenfassung der Verbesserungen:\n\n- **Titel & Quellenangabe**: Natürlicher Ausdruck „aus den Fabeln des Äsop“ statt „aus Äsops Fabeln“.\n- **Idiomatische Wendungen**: „huschte ihm über die Nase“, „nachstellte“, „Maschen eines Netzes“.\n- **Präzise Lexik**: „vergelten“ statt „danken“ oder „belohnen“; „gefasst“ → „gefasst hielten“ → „gefesselt hielten“ für größere Treffsicherheit.\n- **Stilistische Feinheiten**: Aktivierung durch „drückte“ statt „legte“, „rannte“ statt „lief“ für Dynamik.\n- **Moral**: „Keine Güte geht verloren“ — idiomatisch, traditionell und prägnant.\n- **Pädagogische Klarheit**: Fragen und Lücken sind klar formuliert und laden zur Reflexion ein.\n\n---\n\nDiese Version ist ideal für den Unterricht: flüssig, bildhaft, sprachlich korrekt und didaktisch aufbereitet — mit Respekt vor dem Original und dem Geist der Fabel.\n\nMöchten Sie eine Variante mit Wortschatzerklärungen, Illustrationshinweisen oder einer vereinfachten Lesefassung für jüngere Kinder?

Durch seinen Schlaf gestört, legte der Löwe wütend seine riesige Pfote auf das winzige Geschöpf, um sie zu töten.\n\n„Verschone mich!“, flehte die arme Maus. „Lass mich bitte gehen, und eines Tages werde ich dir sicherlich dafür danken.“\n\nDer Löwe amüsierte sich sehr darüber, dass eine Maus ihm jemals helfen könnte. Doch er war großzügig und ließ die Maus schließlich frei.\n\nEinige Tage später, während er im Wald seiner Beute nachstellte, geriet der Löwe in die Maschen eines Jägernetzes. Da er sich nicht befreien konnte, erfüllte er den Wald mit seinem wütenden Brüllen. Die Maus erkannte die Stimme und fand schnell den Löwen, der im Netz kämpfte. Sie lief zu einem der dicken Seile, die ihn festhielten, nagte daran, bis es zerriss, und bald war der Löwe frei.\n\n„Du hast gelacht, als ich sagte, ich würde dich eines Tages belohnen“, sagte die Maus. „Jetzt siehst du, dass sogar eine Maus einem Löwen helfen kann.“\n\nEine Güte wird niemals vergeudet.\n\nWarum glaubt der Löwe, dass die Maus ihn nicht belohnen kann?\n\nWas ist eine Fabel?\n\nEine Fabel ist eine kurze Geschichte, die gewöhnlich zwei Hauptfiguren enthält.

    "llm_output_test3": "text: サンプル研究報告  \nユニタブ社のスタッフおよびチームミーティングにおける携帯電話使用に関する調査\n\n概要  \n過去5年間で、個人の携帯電話の使用は大幅に増加しており、今後も継続する見込みである。ブラック（2003）によると、2008年までにはオーストラリアの労働者の約90％が個人の携帯電話を所持していると予測されている。ブラックはこの現象を「社会のコミュニケーション基盤を潜在的に危険にさらす深刻な問題」と表現している（2003, p. 17）。現在、ユニタブ社の従業員のうち60％が個人の携帯電話を所有している。\n\n最近、複数のスタッフが会議中に携帯電話を使用することについて不満を述べ、公式な会社方針の有無を問うている。現時点では、携帯電話の使用に関する公式な会社方針は存在しない。本報告書では、スタッフおよびチームミーティングにおける携帯電話使用の問題に焦点を当て、他の時間帯における職場での携帯電話使用については検討しない（ただし、一部の懸念点は提起されている）。\n\n本報告書における「個人の携帯電話」とは、私用通話のために個人で負担した携帯電話を指し、特定の業務に関連して企業が支給した携帯電話とは区別される。\n\n方法  \n本調査は、ユニタブ社のスタッフメンバーを対象としたアンケート調査によって実施された。合計324部のアンケートが、従業員の給与明細とともに配布された（付録A参照）。アンケートでは、リッカート尺度を用いて携帯電話使用に対する社会的態度を評価し（スミス, 2003）、追加の意見を記入できる自由回答欄も設けた。アンケート回収箱は各支店に4週間にわたって設置された。個人情報は一切収集せず、調査は自発的かつ匿名で行われた。\n\n結果  \nアンケートへの回答率は85％であった。回答の内訳を下記の表1に示す。結果から明らかのように、携帯電話は会議中には扰乱的であり、オフにするべきだと考えられている。\n\n表1：スタッフおよびチームミーティングにおける個人の携帯電話使用に関する意見\n\n| | 強く同意 | 同意 | 不同意 | 強く不同意 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 問題ではない | 8 | - | 28 | 24 |\n| 問題である | 30 | 38 | 10 | 8 |\n| 携帯電話は扰乱的である | 60 | 10 | - | 4 |\n| 携帯電話は許可されるべきである | 6 | 12 | 52 | 22 |\n| 携帯電話はオフにするべきである | 68 | 10 | 4 | 2 |\n| 特定の状況下では許可されるべきである | 10 | 52 | 23 | 13 |\n\nまた、アンケートでは、会議中に携帯電話の使用を許可すべき状況や、会議中に個人の電話を受け取ることに対するスタッフの態度についても自由回答形式で評価した。その結果、医療や緊急事態などの特定の状況では個人の電話の受信が許容されると考えられているが、一般的には必要ないと考えられていることが分かった。\n\n考察および結論  \n表1の結果から、個人の携帯電話の使用は問題であると認識されているが、特定の状況下では許可されるべきであるとの意見もあることが明らかである。85％の回答者が携帯電話は非常に扰乱的であると考えており、会議中はオフにするべきだと強く支持している（88％）。一方で、12％の回答者は、会議中の携帯電話使用は問題ではないと考えているが、88％の回答者は問題であると感じている。調査全体を通じて、これらの結果は一貫している。\n\n多くの回答者（84％）は、例外的な状況（例：医療）では携帯電話の使用を許可すべきだと感じているが、その際には関連するプロトコルが必要であると指摘している。\n\nこれらの知見は他の研究とも一致している。スミス（2008）によると、多くの企業が携帯電話を扰乱的と認識し、会議中の使用を禁止している。ナビア（2003）は、スタッフの会議時間の30％が不要な携帯電話の割り込みによって浪費されていると主張している。これは時間管理、生産性、チームの集中力に悪影響を及ぼす。\n\n結論  \nスタッフミーティングにおける携帯電話の使用は明らかに扰乱的であり、オフにするべきである。ほとんどのスタッフは、特定の状況を除き、会議中に個人の電話を受け取る必要はないと考えているが、まずはチームリーダー、マネージャー、または議長から許可を得るべきである。\n\n推奨事項  \nユニタブ社は、スタッフミーティングにおける携帯電話の使用に関する公式の方針を策定することが推奨される。この方針には以下の内容を含めるべきである：\n\n- スタッフミーティング中は携帯電話の使用を禁止する。\n- 例外的な状況においてのみ携帯電話を使用可能とするが、その場合は適切なマネージャーや議長の許可が必要である。\n\n最後に、この方針は会社内のすべてのスタッフに適用される必要がある。"

Python 作用域和命名空间\n\n在介绍类之前，我首先需要向您说明 Python 的作用域规则。类定义在命名空间中使用了一些巧妙的技巧，因此您需要了解作用域和命名空间的工作原理，才能完全理解其中的机制。顺便提一下，掌握这一主题的知识对任何高级 Python 程序员都非常有用。\n\n让我们从一些定义开始。命名空间是从名称到对象的映射。目前大多数命名空间通过 Python 字典实现，但通常这种方式在任何方面（除了性能）都不会被察觉，并且未来可能会发生变化。命名空间的例子包括：内置名称集合（包含如 abs() 这样的函数以及内置异常名称）、模块中的全局名称、以及函数调用中的局部名称。从某种意义上说，对象的属性集合也构成一个命名空间。\n\n关于命名空间的重要一点是：不同命名空间中的名称之间没有任何关系。例如，两个不同的模块都可以定义名为 maximize 的函数而不会产生混淆——模块的使用者必须使用模块名作为前缀来引用该函数。顺便提一下，我用“属性”一词指代任何跟在点号后面的名称——例如，在表达式 z.real 中，real 是对象 z 的一个属性。严格来说，对模块内名称的引用也是属性引用：在表达式 modname.funcname 中，modname 是一个模块对象，而 funcname 是它的属性。在这种情况下，模块的属性与模块中定义的全局名称之间恰好存在直接的映射关系：它们共享同一个命名空间！[1]\n\n属性可以是只读的或可写的。在后一种情况下，可以对属性进行赋值。模块属性是可写的：您可以写入 modname.the_answer = 42。可写属性也可以通过 del 语句删除。例如，del modname.the_answer 将从由 modname 命名的对象中移除 the_answer 属性。\n\n命名空间在不同的时刻创建，具有不同的生命周期。包含内置名称的命名空间在 Python 解释器启动时创建，并且永远不会被删除。模块的全局命名空间在模块定义被读取时创建；通常，模块命名空间会持续到解释器退出为止。由解释器顶层调用执行的语句（无论是从脚本文件读取还是交互式输入），被视为名为 __main__ 的模块的一部分，因此它们拥有自己的全局命名空间。（实际上，内置名称也存在于一个模块中，这个模块被称为 builtins。）\n\n函数的局部命名空间在函数被调用时创建，当函数返回或引发未在函数内部处理的异常时被删除。（实际上，“遗忘”可能是描述实际发生情况更准确的说法。）当然，递归调用各自拥有独立的局部命名空间。\n\n作用域是 Python 程序中一个文本区域，其中某个命名空间可以直接访问。“直接访问”在这里意味着对未限定名称的引用尝试在该命名空间中查找名称。尽管作用域是静态确定的，但它们是在运行时动态使用的。在执行过程中的任何时刻，都有 3 或 4 个嵌套的作用域，其命名空间可以直接访问：\n\n- 最内层作用域，最先被搜索，包含局部名称；\n- 任何封闭函数的作用域，从最近的封闭作用域开始搜索，包含非局部但非全局的名称；\n- 倒数第二个作用域包含当前模块的全局名称；\n- 最外层作用域（最后被搜索）包含内置名称的命名空间。\n\n如果某个名称被声明为 global，则所有对该名称的引用和赋值都直接指向倒数第二个作用域（即包含模块全局名称的作用域）。要重新绑定位于最内层作用域之外的变量，可以使用 nonlocal 语句；如果没有声明为 nonlocal，这些变量将是只读的（试图写入此类变量只会创建一个新的局部变量，而不会改变同名的外部变量）。\n\n通常，局部作用域引用的是（文本上）当前函数的局部名称。在函数外部，局部作用域引用与全局作用域相同的命名空间：即模块的命名空间。类定义会在局部作用域中再引入另一个命名空间。\n\n重要的是要认识到，作用域是按文本确定的：在模块中定义的函数的全局作用域就是该模块的命名空间，无论该函数从何处或通过何种别名被调用。另一方面，实际的名称查找是在运行时动态完成的——然而，语言规范正朝着在“编译”时进行静态名称解析的方向发展，因此请不要依赖动态名称解析！（事实上，局部变量已经静态确定。）\n\nPython 的一个特殊之处在于——如果没有 global 或 nonlocal 语句生效——对名称的赋值总是进入最内层作用域。赋值操作并不会复制数据——它们只是将名称绑定到对象。删除操作也是如此：语句 del x 会从局部作用域所引用的命名空间中移除 x 的绑定。事实上，所有引入新名称的操作都使用局部作用域：特别是，import 语句和函数定义会将模块或函数名称绑定到局部作用域中。\n\nglobal 语句可用于指示特定变量存在于全局作用域并应在该处重新绑定；nonlocal 语句则指示特定变量存在于封闭作用域中并应在该处重新绑定。\n\n9.2.1. 作用域和命名空间示例\n\n以下是一个演示如何引用不同作用域和命名空间，以及 global 和 nonlocal 如何影响变量绑定的示例：\n\n```python\ndef scope_test():\n    def do_local():\n        spam = \"local spam\"\n\n    def do_nonlocal():\n        nonlocal spam\n        spam = \"nonlocal spam\"\n\n    def do_global():\n        global spam\n        spam = \"global spam\"\n\n    spam = \"test spam\"\n    do_local()\n    print(\"After local assignment:\", spam)\n    do_nonlocal()\n    print(\"After nonlocal assignment:\", spam)\n    do_global()\n    print(\"After global assignment:\", spam)\n\nscope_test()\nprint(\"In global scope:\", spam)\n```\n\n示例代码的输出结果为：\n\n```\nAfter local assignment: test spam\nAfter nonlocal assignment: nonlocal spam\nAfter global assignment: nonlocal spam\nIn global scope: global spam\n```\n\n请注意，局部赋值（默认行为）并未改变 scope_test 对 spam 的绑定。nonlocal 赋值改变了 scope_test 对 spam 的绑定，而 global 赋值则改变了模块级别的绑定。您还可以看到，在 global 赋值之前，spam 并不存在任何先前的绑定。",
