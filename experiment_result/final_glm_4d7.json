Despite this windfall, he insists he won’t indulge in typical “celebrity excesses” like buying luxury cars or partying wildly.\n  \n- **Humble Spending Habits**: He says he prefers spending on modest items — books, CDs, DVDs — costing around £10 each. This reflects his grounded personality despite fame and fortune.\n\n- **New Legal Freedoms**: At 18, he can now gamble in casinos, buy alcohol in pubs, and watch R-rated films like *Hostel: Part II* — though he’s more focused on celebrating with a private party (details undisclosed).\n\n- **Media Scrutiny**: He anticipates increased media attention now that he’s an adult, acknowledging he’ll be “fair game” for tabloids. He’s determined not to fall into the “kid star gone wild” stereotype.\n\n- **Career Beyond Harry Potter**: While continuing to star in the final two *Harry Potter* films (*Order of the Phoenix* was breaking box office records at the time), Radcliffe is branching out:\n  - TV movie *My Boy Jack* (about Rudyard Kipling)\n  - Australian film *December Boys*\n  - Stage debut in *Equus*, showcasing his range beyond Potter\n\n---\n\n### Tone & Purpose:\n\nThe article balances **celebratory tone** with **journalistic restraint**, highlighting Radcliffe’s maturity and self-awareness. It counters tabloid expectations by emphasizing his humility and focus on serious acting roles. The piece also subtly reassures fans and the public that their beloved child star is growing up responsibly.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n> As Daniel Radcliffe turns 18, he gains access to a £20 million fortune from the *Harry Potter* franchise — but promises no wild spending sprees. Instead, he plans to stay grounded, continue acting seriously in theater and film, and avoid tabloid traps. Though media scrutiny will intensify, Radcliffe remains focused on his craft — proving he’s more than just the boy wizard.\n\n--- \n\n**Note**: This article was published in 2007, so it reflects Radcliffe’s life and career at that point — long before his later acclaimed roles in *The Woman in Black*, *Kill Your Darlings*, *Swiss Army Man*, and *Miracle Workers*.\n\n---\n\n## Document 2 Summary\n\nThis article, part of CNN’s *Behind the Scenes* series, is a powerful and sobering report by correspondent **Soledad O’Brien** from the **“forgotten floor”** — the ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention center — where many **mentally ill inmates** are held before trial. The piece blends on-the-ground reporting with expert commentary from **Judge Steven Leifman**, a local advocate for reforming how the justice system handles mental illness.\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 **Key Points & Analysis**\n\n#### 1. **The “Forgotten Floor”**\n- Located on the **9th floor** of Miami-Dade’s pretrial detention facility.\n- Houses inmates with **severe mental illnesses**, often arrested for **non-violent or “avoidable” offenses** (e.g., drug possession, resisting arrest).\n- These individuals frequently **do not receive adequate mental health care** while incarcerated.\n- Judge Leifman calls it a systemic failure: mentally ill people are **punished rather than treated**.\n\n#### 2. **Conditions Inside**\n- Inmates wear **sleeveless robes** (like modified sleeping bags) to prevent self-harm.\n- No shoes, laces, or mattresses — all potential tools for suicide or injury.\n- Cells are **small, loud, and harshly lit** — designed for security, not therapy.\n- Some inmates are **naked or delusional**; one believes he’s the president’s son and demands release.\n\n#### 3. **Systemic Issues**\n- **One-third** of Miami-Dade jail inmates are mentally ill — overwhelming the system.\n- Many cycle between jails and brief hospitalizations, never receiving long-term treatment.\n- Judge Leifman traces the problem back centuries:\n  - Mentally ill were once locked up as “lunatics” without charges.\n  - Later moved to state hospitals — which became infamous for abuse and neglect.\n  - After deinstitutionalization in the mid-20th century, many ended up **homeless and untreated**.\n  - Today, **only ~50,000** people are in state mental hospitals — down from **over 500,000 in 1955**.\n\n#### 4. **Reform Efforts**\n- Since **2008**, Judge Leifman has pushed for diverting mentally ill defendants **away from jail** and into **mental health facilities**.\n- This is seen as a **win-win**: better outcomes for patients, relief for families, and cost savings for the state.\n- It’s not a complete solution, but a **critical first step** toward treating mental illness as a **health issue**, not a criminal one.\n\n---\n\n### 💬 **Why This Matters**\n\nThis article shines a light on a national crisis: **the criminalization of mental illness**. Instead of receiving care, millions of Americans with serious mental health conditions end up in jails — often for minor offenses — because there’s no safety net. Miami’s “forgotten floor” is symbolic of what happens when society fails its most vulnerable.\n\nJudge Leifman’s work represents a growing movement to **reform the justice system** through **mental health courts**, diversion programs, and community-based treatment — alternatives that prioritize healing over punishment.\n\n---\n\n### 📌 **Takeaway Quote**\n\n> “It’s brutally unjust... and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in Miami.”\n\nThis line encapsulates the moral urgency of the story. What we’re seeing isn’t just policy failure — it’s **human suffering** that could be prevented with compassion and proper resources.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Conclusion**\n\nSoledad O’Brien’s report is both a **journalistic exposé** and a **call to action**. By taking readers inside the “forgotten floor,” she humanizes those often invisible to the public eye. With Judge Leifman’s voice guiding the narrative, the article offers not only critique but also hope — showing that change is possible when justice systems begin to see mental illness as a medical condition, not a crime.\n\n---\n\n📌 **Further Reading / Action:**  \nIf you're moved by this story, consider learning about **mental health courts**, supporting organizations like the **National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)**, or advocating for policies that fund community mental health services instead of incarceration.\n\n--- \n\nLet me know if you’d like a summary tailored for students, policymakers, or general public awareness!\n\n---\n",

    "llm_output_test2": "summary: \n## Document 1 Summary\n\nThis article from **CNN**, reporting on the **Minneapolis bridge collapse**, is a powerful compilation of **eyewitness accounts and rescue efforts** following a catastrophic infrastructure failure. Here's a breakdown and summary:\n\n---\n\n### 📍 **Location & Context**\n- **Where**: Minneapolis, Minnesota — specifically the I-35W Mississippi River bridge.\n- **Event**: Sudden, dramatic collapse of the bridge during rush hour, sending vehicles plunging into the river below.\n- **Tone**: Urgent, emotional, and journalistic — focusing on human survival, chaos, and heroism.\n\n---\n\n### 👥 **Key Eyewitness Accounts**\n\n#### 1. **Gary Babineau (Survivor)**\n- Experienced a **30–35 foot free fall** in his pickup truck.\n- His truck was **ripped in half**, yet he survived with only a back injury.\n- Immediately helped **rescue children from a school bus**, carrying injured kids to safety.\n- Described the collapse as “like out of the movies” — sudden, violent, and surreal.\n- No formal rescue training: “I just knew what I had to do at the moment.”\n\n#### 2. **Melissa Hughes (Driver)**\n- Felt **two free-fall sensations** as the western edge collapsed under her car.\n- A **pickup landed on top of her vehicle**, but she was unharmed.\n- Called the experience “very surreal.”\n\n#### 3. **Bernie Toivonen (Driver)**\n- His car ended up **tilted at a 45-degree angle** after the collapse.\n- Believed he was going to die — then realized he was alive when his car stabilized.\n- Turned off the engine and said, “Oh, I’m alive.”\n\n---\n\n### 🚑 **Rescue Efforts**\n\n- **Dr. John Hink (Emergency Room Physician)**:\n  - Drove to the scene within **15 minutes** of hearing the news.\n  - Found dozens of injured people stranded on the **middle of the Mississippi River**, inaccessible from the south bank.\n  - Moved to the **north side** for better access.\n  - Ambulances struggled to reach victims due to terrain; **pickup trucks with medics** were used to ferry injured people to higher ground.\n  - **55 people** were rescued and loaded into ambulances within **two hours**.\n  - Praised the **organized, controlled nature** of the rescue — contrasting sharply with the chaotic collapse.\n\n---\n\n### 💬 **Themes & Takeaways**\n\n- **Suddenness & Shock**: The collapse happened without warning — described as “rumble… then all gave way.”\n- **Heroism Amid Chaos**: Ordinary citizens like Babineau became impromptu rescuers.\n- **Resilience & Survival**: Multiple survivors recount moments of thinking they were dead — only to realize they’d lived.\n- **Community Response**: Volunteers, EMTs, doctors, and even private citizens mobilized quickly despite logistical challenges.\n- **Media Role**: CNN and AP captured raw, immediate reactions — helping document history and human emotion.\n\n---\n\n### 📌 Final Summary\n\n> In the wake of the devastating collapse of the I-35W bridge in Minneapolis, survivors recounted terrifying falls, miraculous escapes, and spontaneous acts of bravery. With no time to react, drivers plunged into the river or dangled precariously over broken spans. Yet amid the chaos, everyday people — including a doctor who raced to the scene and a truck driver who saved schoolchildren — stepped up to rescue the injured. Despite the horror, the response was remarkably organized, saving dozens of lives in under two hours. The event stands as a testament to both the fragility of infrastructure and the resilience of human spirit.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you’d like this rewritten as a news summary, timeline, or educational resource.\n\n---\n\n## Document 2 Summary\n\nThis article from **CNN** reports on **President George W. Bush’s routine colonoscopy**, performed on a Saturday at Camp David, during which **five small polyps were removed**. Here's a concise summary and analysis:\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 **Key Facts:**\n\n- **Procedure**: Colonoscopy performed at Camp David.\n- **Polyps Removed**: Five small polyps (all under 1 cm / 0.5 inches), described as “not worrisome” by White House spokesman Scott Stanzel.\n- **Testing**: Polyps sent to National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda for microscopic analysis; results expected in 2–3 days.\n- **Anesthesia**: Monitored anesthesia care — President was asleep but not under full general anesthesia.\n- **Presidential Power**: Vice President Dick Cheney temporarily assumed presidential duties from approximately 7:21 a.m. to 9:21 a.m. No major events required action during that time.\n- **Recovery & Activities**: Bush was in good spirits afterward, played with his dogs (Barney and Miss Beazley), had lunch, received briefings, and planned a bike ride.\n- **Medical Team**: Supervised by Dr. Richard Tubb (Bush’s personal physician) and conducted by a team from the National Naval Medical Center.\n- **Previous History**: Last colonoscopy in June 2002 showed no abnormalities. Recommended repeat every ~5 years.\n- **Public Health Message**: Bush encouraged public surveillance/screening for colorectal cancer. Spokesman Tony Snow — himself undergoing chemotherapy for colon cancer that spread to his liver — reinforced this message.\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 **Context & Significance:**\n\n- **Routine Screening**: The procedure was preventive, not emergency. Colonoscopies are recommended starting at age 50 for average-risk individuals (per American Cancer Society).\n- **Transparency**: The White House provided detailed updates, emphasizing normalcy and health — likely to reassure the public and model healthy behavior.\n- **Political Symbolism**: Cheney briefly assuming power highlights constitutional continuity procedures (under the 25th Amendment), even for short, non-emergency medical procedures.\n- **Personal Connection**: Tony Snow’s own cancer battle adds emotional weight to the public health message — making it more relatable and urgent.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Takeaway:**\n\nPresident Bush underwent a standard, precautionary colonoscopy where five benign-looking polyps were removed. He recovered quickly, resumed activities, and used the moment to promote colorectal cancer screening — especially important given his age (60 at the time) and the broader public health context. The event also demonstrated smooth presidential succession protocols and underscored the importance of preventive medicine.\n\n---\n\n### 📌 Additional Note:\n\nThe inclusion of Tony Snow’s personal cancer journey adds depth and authenticity to the article, turning a routine medical update into a powerful public health advocacy moment.\n\n--- \n\n*Source: CNN, Washington D.C., date not specified in text but likely early 2007 (based on Bush’s presidency timeline and Snow’s cancer diagnosis).*\n\n---\n\n## Document 3 Summary\n\nThis article from **CNN** details the **indefinite suspension of NFL quarterback Michael Vick** by the league following his admission to involvement in a **dogfighting ring**, known as “Bad Newz Kennels.” Here's a structured summary and analysis:\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 **Key Facts & Timeline**\n\n### 📅 **Event: August 2007**\n- **Michael Vick**, then starting QB for the **Atlanta Falcons**, is **indefinitely suspended without pay** by NFL Commissioner **Roger Goodell**.\n- Suspension is pending legal proceedings; Goodell reserves the right to review it afterward.\n\n---\n\n## ⚖️ **Legal Proceedings & Plea Agreement**\n\n- Vick **pleads guilty** to one federal charge:\n  > **“Conspiracy to Travel in Interstate Commerce in Aid of Unlawful Activities and to Sponsor a Dog in an Animal Fighting Venture.”**\n  \n- **Penalties if convicted:**\n  - Up to **5 years in prison**\n  - $250,000 fine\n  - Full restitution\n  - 3 years supervised release\n\n- Prosecutors agree to seek the **minimum sentence** under guidelines — indicating cooperation was valued.\n\n- **Vick admitted**:\n  - Buying pit bulls and property used for training/fighting.\n  - Participating in killing **6–8 dogs** that performed poorly in “testing” sessions.\n  - Methods included **hanging and drowning**.\n  - Did **not bet** or receive gambling proceeds (though he funded most operations).\n\n- Co-conspirators:\n  - **Tony Taylor, Quanis Phillips, Purnell Peace** — already pleaded guilty in exchange for reduced sentences.\n\n---\n\n## 🐶 **Animal Welfare & Legal Implications**\n\n- Approximately **53 pit bulls** seized from Vick’s Virginia property.\n- Government seeks permission to **euthanize** some dogs — supported by animal rights groups.\n- Dogs may also serve as **evidence** in ongoing cases.\n\n- **State charges possible**: CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin notes that **Virginia could file state charges** based on admissions made in federal court — even for same conduct.\n\n---\n\n## 💼 **NFL & Team Response**\n\n- **NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell**:\n  > “Your admitted conduct was not only illegal, but also cruel and reprehensible... The NFL will not tolerate conduct that tarnishes its reputation.”\n\n- **Falcons owner Arthur Blank**:\n  > Called actions “incomprehensible and unacceptable,” supported suspension as a strong message.\n\n- **Financial consequences**:\n  - Falcons may reclaim **$22 million** of Vick’s $130M signing bonus (per AP).\n  - Vick must pay **full restitution** for care/euthanasia costs of seized dogs.\n\n---\n\n## 🤝 **Cooperation Clause**\n\nVick agreed to:\n- Fully cooperate with investigators.\n- Testify if needed.\n- Submit to polygraph tests.\n- Turn over documents.\n- Pay all associated costs for dog care or euthanasia.\n\n---\n\n## 🧭 **What’s Next?**\n\n- **Court appearance scheduled for Monday** — Vick expected to formally plead guilty before Judge **Henry E. Hudson**.\n- Judge has final say on plea deal acceptance.\n- Potential for **state prosecution** in Virginia.\n- Long-term career implications uncertain — Falcons have not yet decided whether to keep him.\n\n---\n\n## 📌 **Significance & Impact**\n\nThis case marked a turning point in how professional sports leagues handle off-field criminal behavior — especially involving **animal cruelty**. It sparked national outrage, led to widespread condemnation, and significantly damaged Vick’s public image.\n\nIt also highlighted the **intersection of federal law, state jurisdiction, and corporate accountability** in professional sports.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **Summary (TL;DR)**\n\n> **Michael Vick was indefinitely suspended by the NFL after pleading guilty to running a dogfighting ring (“Bad Newz Kennels”). He admitted to funding the operation and participating in killing underperforming dogs. Though he didn’t gamble or profit directly, prosecutors accepted his guilty plea with a promise of leniency. The Falcons may recover millions in bonuses, and Vick faces up to 5 years in prison. State charges are possible. Over 50 dogs were seized; some may be euthanized. His future in the NFL hangs in the balance.**\n\n---\n\n## 📚 Additional Resources Mentioned\n\n- [Watch what led to Vick’s suspension](#) *(link placeholder)*\n- [Timeline of the case against Vick](#) *(link placeholder)*\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you’d like a visual timeline, comparison with other athlete suspensions, or deeper legal analysis!\n\n---\n",

The Start node accepts `pic_list`, the Iteration node processes the list of images, the LLM node is connected to the Iteration Start node, the Template Transform node aggregates the summaries, the Markdown Exporter converts the text to DOCX, the List Operator extracts the DOCX file, and the End node outputs the results. The workflow does not violate the design_principle.\nb. Exact Node Set Matching: The nodes extracted from the workflow JSON are ['start', 'iteration', 'iteration-start', 'llm', 'template-transform', 'markdown-exporter', 'list-operator', 'end']. These exactly match the node_selection list ['Start', 'Iteration', 'Iteration-Start', 'LLM', 'Template', 'Markdown Exporter', 'List Operator', 'End'] when considering case insensitivity. Therefore, Rule 2 is satisfied.\n",

The paper was presented at **ICLR (International Conference on Learning Representations)** and is affiliated with **The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Main Content**\n\n#### **1. Introduction**\n- **Phase retrieval** aims to reconstruct an *n*-dimensional signal **x** from its magnitude-only measurements:  \n  `y_i = |⟨a_i, x⟩|²`, for i=1,...,m.\n- The problem is underdetermined and nonconvex, but recovery is possible up to a global phase if the number of measurements *m* is sufficiently large (e.g., *m ≥ 2n−1* for real signals).\n- Two common empirical loss functions are introduced:\n  - **Intensity-based loss** `f_I(x)` — smooth, suitable for gradient-based optimization.\n  - **Amplitude-based loss** `f_A(x)` — non-smooth due to square root, but has better curvature properties near the solution.\n- The authors focus on **sparse phase retrieval**, where the true signal **x** is *s*-sparse. Recovery is possible with *m = min{2s, 2n−1}* measurements for real signals.\n\n#### **2. Main Results**\nThe paper proposes a **dual-loss strategy** algorithm that combines the benefits of both loss functions:\n\n- **Step 1: Identify free and fixed variables**\n  - Uses amplitude-based loss `f_A` to identify the support (nonzero entries) via hard-thresholding.\n  - Fixed variables (outside support) are set to zero; only free variables are updated.\n\n- **Step 2: Compute search direction**\n  - Uses intensity-based loss `f_I` to compute an approximate Newton direction over the identified support.\n  - Leverages second-order information for faster convergence than first-order methods.\n\n> **Key innovation**: Exploiting the superior curvature of `f_A` for support identification and the smoothness of `f_I` for efficient descent.\n\n##### **Algorithm Summary (Proposed Algorithm)**\nInput: sensing vectors {a_i}, measurements {y_i}, sparsity s, initial estimate x⁰, stepsize η.  \nFor k = 1,2,... do:\n1. Identify free variables S_{k+1} using hard-thresholding on gradient of f_A.\n2. Compute approximate Newton direction p^k over S_{k+1}.\n3. Update x^{k+1} = x^k - p^k, setting fixed variables to zero.\nOutput: Final estimate x^{k+1}.\n\n##### **Theoretical Results**\n- **Theorem 1**: Under sufficient measurements (*m ≥ c₁s² log n*), the algorithm converges to the ground truth **x** at a **quadratic rate** after *O(log(∥x⁰∥/x_min³))* iterations, where *x_min* is the smallest nonzero entry in magnitude.\n- The algorithm achieves **lowest iteration complexity** among state-of-the-art methods while maintaining similar per-iteration cost.\n- It’s the **first algorithm** to establish **quadratic convergence** for sparse phase retrieval.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Experiments**\nThe paper evaluates the proposed method against several baselines: CoPRAM, HTP, ThWF, SparTA.\n\n- **Figure 1**: Relative error vs. iterations (for noise-free and noisy cases). The proposed method converges faster than all others.\n- **Figure 2**: Phase transition plots (probability of success vs. number of measurements) for sparsity levels *s=25* and *s=50*. The proposed method achieves high success rates with fewer measurements.\n\n---\n\n#### **References**\nIncludes key works on phase retrieval, including Wirtinger Flow, truncated amplitude flow, and recent advances in sparse phase retrieval.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe paper presents a novel, provably fast algorithm for sparse phase retrieval that combines dual-loss strategies to achieve quadratic convergence — a significant theoretical and practical improvement over existing methods.

Motivation**\n\n- **Problem**: Natural language intents are ambiguous, especially for complex tasks like manipulating Pandas DataFrames.\n- **Solution**: Use auxiliary I/O specifications to clarify what the input/output should look like.\n  - Example: Task “Get average duration to and from all cities for each airline” → needs specs like input columns (`airline`, `source_city`, `destination_city`) and output structure (`Airline`, `Delhi`, `Mumbai`, `Chennai`).\n- Even with specs, LLMs often fail to follow them — they need to be *aligned* with the specs.\n- Introducing **GIFT4Code**: A grounded instruction fine-tuning method that uses synthetic data and execution-derived signals to improve alignment.\n\n---\n\n### **2. GIFT4Code Method**\n\nA 3-step process:\n\n#### Step 1: Generate Intents + Code Context\n- Use few-shot prompting + **PALM** to generate NL intents from 7500 CSV files on GitHub.\n- Example intent: “Show the top three countries with the highest GDP”\n\n#### Step 2: Execute Code & Collect Results\n- Run the generated code to get actual output (e.g., list of strings or DataFrame).\n- This provides concrete I/O examples.\n\n#### Step 3: Augment Intents with I/O Specs\n- Create different types of I/O specs based on execution:\n  - **TypeDesc**: Variable names/types (e.g., `pandas.DataFrame`)\n  - **I/O Examples**: Concrete input/output pairs\n  - **I/O Summary**: LLM-generated summaries of I/O structure (e.g., “output has columns: Country, City, Population”)\n- These augmented intents form a **synthetic dataset** for fine-tuning.\n\n> **Key innovation**: Use **execution results** to create grounding signals for training — making the model learn to align code with specs.\n\n---\n\n### **3.

The work is authored by Runqi Lin, Chaojian Yu, Bo Han, Hang Su, and Tongliang Liu from the University of Sydney, Hong Kong Baptist University, and Tsinghua University.\n\n---\n\n### 🎯 **Main Objective**\nTo understand and prevent **Catastrophic Overfitting (CO)** — a phenomenon in adversarial training where models rapidly lose robustness after just a few training steps — by identifying and disrupting **pseudo-robust shortcuts** that form primarily in earlier network layers.\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Key Findings & Contributions\n\n### 1. **Overview of CO Dynamics**\n- During CO, **earlier layers** exhibit greater sensitivity and distortion than later layers.\n- CO is triggered by the formation of **pseudo-robust shortcuts** — model behaviors that appear robust to single-step attacks (like FGSM) but fail under stronger attacks (like PGD), bypassing genuine robust learning.\n- The proposed **Layer-Aware Adversarial Weight Perturbation (LAP)** method aims to obstruct these shortcuts and prevent CO.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Layers Transformation During CO**\n*(Figure 1: Loss landscape visualization)*\n- **Before CO**: Flat loss landscapes for both whole model and individual layers.\n- **During CO**: Sharper loss landscapes emerge, especially in **former layers (1st–5th)**, indicating increased sensitivity.\n- **After CO**: Decision boundaries become severely distorted; former layers show extreme distortion.\n\n> ✅ **Insight**: CO manifests first and most severely in early layers, suggesting they are critical to the emergence of pseudo-robust behavior.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Pseudo-Robust Shortcut Dependency**\n*(Figure 2: Singular values of convolution kernels)*\n- Before CO: Uniform singular value distribution across layers.\n- After CO: Increased variance in singular values, especially in **early layers**, leading to sharper model outputs.\n- Removing weights (especially large ones) from early layers in CO-affected models:\n  - Reduces accuracy under **FGSM** (single-step attack).\n  - Slightly *increases* accuracy under **PGD** (multi-step attack).\n\n> ⚠️ **Performance Paradox**: Models rely on pseudo-shortcuts (large weights in early layers) to “fake” robustness against FGSM, but this harms true robustness (PGD). Removing these shortcuts can resolve the paradox.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Proposed Method: Layer-Aware Adversarial Weight Perturbation (LAP)**\n\n#### Optimization Objective (Equation 1):\nMinimize adversarial loss with layer-aware perturbations:\n```\nmin_w 1/n Σ max_δ_i,ν_i ℓ(f_{w+ν_i}(x_i + δ_i), y_i)\n```\n\n#### Three Key Strategies:\n1. **Accumulate weight perturbations** in early layers to break persistent shortcuts via larger alterations.\n2. **Concurrently perturb inputs AND weights** to prevent stable shortcut formation.\n3. **Gradually decreasing perturbation magnitude** from early to late layers (Equation 2):\n   ```\n   λ_l = β · [1 - (ln(l)/ln(L+1))^γ], for l=1,...,L\n   ```\n   → Avoids unnecessary noise in later layers.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Theoretical Analysis**\n- Provides a **PAC-Bayes bound** for LAP, showing generalization performance can be controlled:\n  ```\n  E[ℓ(f_{w+ν})] ≤ ê(f_w) + {max[ê(f_{w+ν}) - ê(f_w)]} + 4√[1/n Σ(1/(2λ_l²)) + ln(2n/δ)]\n  ```\n  → Justifies that LAP improves robustness while maintaining generalization.\n\n---\n\n## 📌 Conclusion & Impact\n\n- **Pseudo-robust shortcuts** are key drivers of CO, forming predominantly in **early layers** and relying on **large weights**.\n- **LAP** effectively disrupts these shortcuts via **layer-aware, adaptive weight perturbations**, preventing CO and improving true adversarial robustness.\n- Theoretical and empirical results validate the approach.\n\n---\n\n## 📚 Resources\n🔗 **Paper & Code**:  \n👉 [https://github.com/tmllab/2024_ICML_LAP](https://github.com/tmllab/2024_ICML_LAP)\n\nQR code provided for quick access.\n\n---\n\n✅ **Takeaway**: This work provides deep insights into the *mechanism* behind catastrophic overfitting and offers a principled, theoretically grounded solution (LAP) to mitigate it — advancing the field of adversarial robustness in deep learning.\n\n---\n\n## Image 2 Summary\n\nThis poster presents **SubTB(λ)**, a novel training objective for **Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets)**, designed to improve their convergence and stability, particularly in challenging environments.\n\n### Core Problem & Solution\nGFlowNets learn to sample discrete/compositional objects (like molecules or graphs) from a target distribution defined by a reward function. Training involves learning a stochastic policy to generate trajectories from an initial state to a terminating state. The paper introduces **Subtrajectory Balance (SubTB(λ))**, which trains the model using *partial* trajectories sampled from a complete trajectory, rather than the full trajectory as in standard Trajectory Balance (TB).\n\n### Key Findings\n1.  **Improved Convergence & Stability**: SubTB(λ) consistently converges faster than TB across various tasks (Hypergrid, Bit Sequences, Biological Sequence Generation) and is less sensitive to hyperparameters.\n2.  **Enables Harder Tasks**: It allows successful training in environments with sparse rewards or long action sequences where standard methods fail.\n3.  **Lower Gradient Variance**: The improved performance is attributed to SubTB(λ) having lower variance in its stochastic gradients compared to TB.\n4.  **Interpolation**: The parameter λ smoothly interpolates between the high-bias, low-variance Detailed Balance (DB) objective (λ → 0⁺) and the low-bias, high-variance TB objective (λ → ∞).\n\n### Technical Details\n*   **Objective Function**: SubTB(λ) minimizes a convex combination of subtrajectory balance losses for all possible subtrajectories within a sampled complete trajectory τ.\n    `L_SubTB(λ)(τ) = Σ L_SubTB(τ_m,n) * λ^(n-m) / Σ λ^(n-m)`\n*   **Implementation**: Can be used on-policy or off-policy (e.g., with replay buffers).\n*   **Parametrization**: Uses state flow F(s;θ) and policies P_F(-|s;θ), P_B(-|s;θ) over (partial) trajectories τ.\n\n### Experimental Results\n*   **Hypergrid**: SubTB(λ=0.9) achieves significantly faster convergence than TB on grids up to 32x32, including \"hard\" variants.\n*   **Bit Sequences**: SubTB(λ) learns policies with higher correlation to the reward and discovers more modes faster than other algorithms (GFN-TB, GFN-DB, SAC, AAC-ER, MCMC).\n*   **Biological Sequences**: Outperforms other methods on generating high-reward antimicrobial peptides (AMP) and fluorescent proteins (GFP), achieving both higher top-100 reward and diversity.\n\n### Gradient Analysis\nThe small-batch gradient estimate of SubTB(λ) is shown to be a better estimator of the large-batch TB gradient than the small-batch TB gradient itself, despite being biased. This explains its superior empirical performance.\n\nIn summary, SubTB(λ) is a robust and effective method for training GFlowNets, offering significant improvements in speed, stability, and applicability to complex problems.\n\n---\n",

Mathematical notation is used extensively but explained contextually.\n\n---\n\n✅ **In summary**: This work provides a theoretically grounded, practically inspired algorithm for multi-agent RL, proving that **local updates can lead to global optimality** under reasonable assumptions — a significant step toward reliable, scalable multi-agent systems.\n\n---\n\n## Image 2 Summary\n\nThis image is a research poster titled **“REFACtor: Learning to Extract Theorems from Proofs”**, presented by Jin Peng Zhou, Yuhuai Wu, Qiyang Li, and Roger Grosse from the University of Toronto and Vector Institute.\n\n---\n\n### **Main Goal**\nThe project introduces **REFACtor**, a neural network-based method designed to **automatically extract modular, reusable theorems** from formal mathematical proofs — mimicking how human mathematicians organize proofs into lemmas and reusable components.\n\n---\n\n## Key Sections & Findings\n\n### 1. **Motivation**\n- Human theorem proving relies on recognizing and reusing modular components (lemmas).\n- Existing proof libraries (like Metamath) lack explicit labels for these components, making them hard to use for supervised learning.\n- Research Question: *Can we train a neural network to mimic human ability to extract useful modular components?*\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Contribution**\n- A novel method to train neural networks to extract reusable theorems.\n- Implemented within the **Metamath** theorem proving framework.\n- Created a **synthetic dataset via “proof expansion”** — expanding proofs to expose intermediate steps as potential theorem targets.\n- Achieved **19.6% non-trivial accuracy** in extracting unseen human-defined theorems.\n- Extracted theorems help **shorten existing proofs** and improve theorem prover performance when used for training.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Dataset & Pre-processing**\n- Applied to **Metamath’s `set.mm` library** (27,220 theorems).\n- Filtered proofs >1000 nodes or with long character features.\n- Performed **target-wise split** to ensure generalization (training/validation/test sets have disjoint target theorems).\n- Subsampled to balance data: max 100/10 points per theorem for train/test.\n\n> **Figure 1**: Shows heavy-tailed distribution of theorem occurrences — many theorems appear rarely, some very frequently.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Proof Expansion**\n- To create supervision targets, proofs are expanded to reveal intermediate goals (nodes) that could be extracted as lemmas.\n- **Figure 2** illustrates proof trees for theorems `a1i` and `mp1i`, showing how nodes (with names like `wph`, `wps`) and proven propositions (`PROP`) are structured.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **REFACtor Model Architecture**\n- Uses a **Graph Neural Network (GNN)**:\n  - Input: Proof tree graph with node features (character-level tokenization of `N` and `PROP`).\n  - Layers: Two fully connected layers → K GraphSage convolution → two more FC layers with sigmoid output.\n- Task: Node-level binary classification — predict whether a node should be extracted as a theorem.\n- Loss: Binary cross entropy, normalized by number of nodes.\n\n> **Equation (1)** defines the loss function; **(2)** shows optimization over graphs.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Performance: How Many Human-Defined Theorems Does REFACtor Extract?**\n- **Table 1**: Accuracy scales with model size (from 50k to 4M parameters).\n  - E.g., 10M param model: **97.5% node accuracy**, **37.5% proof accuracy** on training set.\n  - Test set: ~84–85% node accuracy, ~13–19% proof accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Can REFACtor Extract New Theorems?**\n- When predictions differ from ground truth, they may still be **valid new theorems**.\n- Validity checked using **Tree & Valid** criteria.\n- From expanded + original datasets, REFACtor found **1907 unique new theorems** (346 Tree & Valid), plus **16** from original set.\n\n> **Table 2**: Breakdown of predictions — significant portion leads to valid new theorems.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Are Newly Extracted Theorems Useful?**\n- Used extracted theorems to **refactor `set.mm`**, compressing it.\n- Augmenting training data with refactored theorems improves theorem prover success rate.\n\n> **Table 3**: Statistics on usage — e.g., 670 theorems used 147,640 times total.\n> \n> **Table 4**: Under 5-minute limit, REFACtor proves **632 out of 2720 test theorems** — **31.0% new theorem usage** (highest among baselines).\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\nREFACtor successfully learns to extract reusable theorems from proofs, achieving non-trivial accuracy and discovering new valid theorems. These extracted theorems are **useful in practice**, improving proof compression and theorem proving performance.\n\n---\n\n### Visual Highlights\n- Color-coded proof trees (Figure 2) show node types and expansion.\n- Bar charts (Figure 1) illustrate dataset imbalance.\n- Tables summarize model performance, theorem validity, and utility.\n\n---\n\nThis work bridges machine learning and formal mathematics, enabling AI systems to better understand and reuse mathematical knowledge — a step toward more human-like automated reasoning.\n\n---\n"

    "design_principle": "1.  **Input Handling**: The Start node accepts `file_list` (array of mixed files).\n2.  **Sorting/Separation**: Two List Operator nodes are used immediately after the start to filter the mixed list into two separate streams: one for documents (`document` type) and one for images (`image` type).\n3.  **Parallel Processing**:\n    *   **Document Branch**: An Iteration node processes the document list. Inside the loop, a Document Extractor gets the text, followed by an LLM node to analyze structure and summarize.\n    *   **Image Branch**: Another Iteration node processes the image list. Inside the loop, an LLM node (vision-capable) takes the image item directly and summarizes the content.\n4.  **Aggregation**: A Code node is used to merge the output arrays from both iterations (doc summaries and image summaries) into a single unified list of summaries. This ensures the final output maintains a sequential order (all docs first, then all images, or vice versa depending on code logic; here we concatenate docs then images).\n5.  **Formatting & Export**: The Template node formats the unified list of summaries into a single Markdown text. This text is then converted to a DOCX file via the Markdown Exporter.\n6.  **Final Output**: A List Operator extracts the single file from the exporter, and the End node outputs the final summary text and the DOCX file.",

He will be replaced by Dana Perino. President Bush praises Snow’s spirit and predicts victory over cancer. Snow, whose health has stabilized, plans to continue public commentary via media while undergoing maintenance chemotherapy.**\n\n---\n\nThis piece serves both as a **news report** and a **tribute** to Snow’s service and personal strength.\n\n---\n\n## Summary 2\n\nThis image is a research poster titled **“Regularized Behavior Cloning for Blocking the Leakage of Past Action Information”** by Seokin Seo, HyeongJoo Hwang, Hongseok Yang, and Kee-Eung Kim from KAIST, presented at the **Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)** conference.\n\n---\n\n### 🎯 **Core Problem:**\nIn **Imitation Learning from Observation Histories (ILOH)**, agents learn from sequences of observations (e.g., images or state vectors) without direct access to past actions. The challenge is that **past action information can unintentionally leak** into the policy’s representation — leading to poor generalization or “copycat” behavior where the agent simply repeats previous actions instead of learning meaningful policies.\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 Key Contributions:\n\n#### 1. **Quantifying Past Action Leakage via HSCIC**\n- Proposes using **Hilbert-Schmidt Conditional Independence Criterion (HSCIC)** — a non-parametric kernel-based metric — to measure how much past action information leaks into the policy’s internal representation.\n- Formally:  \n  `HSCIC(φ_t; a_{t-1}^E | a_t^E)` quantifies dependence between past action `a_{t-1}` and current latent representation `φ_t`, conditioned on current expert action `a_t`.\n- **Advantages of HSCIC:**\n  - ✅ No nested optimization\n  - ✅ No additional neural network needed\n  - ✅ No assumption about data distribution\n\n#### 2. **Regularized Behavior Cloning Framework (PALR)**\nInstead of regularizing actions directly, they **regularize representations**:\n```\nL(π, φ; z_t, a_{t-1}^E, a_t^E, α) := L_bc(...) + α · L_reg(φ; z_t, a_{t-1}^E, a_t^E)\n```\nWhere `L_reg` is based on HSCIC → their method is called **PALR (Past Action Leakage Regularization)**.\n\nThey compare several regularizers:\n- Conditional Entropy (coincides with FCA)\n- Decomposed Mutual Information (has limitations)\n- **HSCIC (proposed)** — shown to be more effective and practical\n\n#### 3. **Empirical Validation**\n- Evaluated on **POMDP versions of D4RL benchmark tasks**: hopper, walker2d, halfcheetah, ant, carla-lane.\n- Compared against baselines: BC (Behavior Cloning), KF, PrimeNet, RAP, FCA, MINE.\n- **Results show:**\n  - Strong **negative correlation** between leakage (HSCIC) and performance → reducing leakage improves imitation.\n  - **PALR consistently outperforms** other methods across most tasks.\n  - Quantitative analysis confirms PALR reduces leakage effectively during training and at convergence.\n\n---\n\n### 📊 Visual Highlights:\n\n- **Left Panel**: Illustrates ILOH setup — observation histories are used as inputs, but past actions are hidden. Red box highlights problematic leakage.\n- **Middle Panels**: Show framework diagram, HSCIC derivation, and comparison of regularizer choices.\n- **Right Panel**: Experimental results tables and plots showing:\n  - Performance scores (normalized 0–100)\n  - HSCIC vs iterations curves (leakage decreases with training)\n  - Sensitivity to regularization coefficient `α`\n\n---\n\n### 💡 Takeaways:\n\n- Past action leakage is a critical issue in ILOH that harms generalization.\n- HSCIC provides a principled, efficient way to quantify this leakage.\n- Regularizing representations (not actions) using HSCIC leads to better policies.\n- **PALR is simple, effective, and doesn’t require extra networks or complex optimization.**\n\n---\n\n### 📚 References Cited:\nIncludes key papers on copycat problems, limitations of BC, kernel methods, and D4RL datasets.\n\n---\n\n✅ **Overall**, this work presents a novel, theoretically grounded, and empirically validated approach to improve imitation learning when only observation histories are available — making it highly relevant for real-world applications like autonomous driving or robotics where action labels may be missing or noisy.\n\n---\n\n## Summary 3\n\nThis image is a research poster titled **“Towards Model-Agnostic Federated Learning Using Knowledge Distillation”** by Andrei Afonin (EPFL) and Sai Praneeth Karimireddy (EPFL & UC Berkeley). It presents novel methods for federated learning that are agnostic to model architecture and data distribution, using knowledge distillation techniques to overcome heterogeneity.\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 **Motivation**\nCurrent federated learning (FL) methods often assume homogeneous models or data. The authors aim to design **model-agnostic FL algorithms** where each agent can train its own preferred model on combined datasets — even when data and models differ across agents.\n\n---\n\n### 🧩 **Framework: Federated Kernel Regression**\nThe paper uses kernel regression as a theoretical framework with two agents:\n- Agent 1 has dataset 𝒟¹ = (𝐗¹, 𝐲¹)\n- Agent 2 has dataset 𝒟² = (𝐗², 𝐲²)\n\nGoal: Find the best global model `g†*` minimizing combined loss + regularization.\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 **Key Algorithms**\n\n### 1. **Alternating Knowledge Distillation (AKD)**\n\n- **Process**: Agents alternate training and exchanging predictions.\n  - Agent 1 trains → predicts labels for Agent 2’s data → Agent 2 trains on those pseudo-labels → vice versa.\n- **Intuition**: Alternating projections between agents’ model spaces.\n- **Proposition I**: Shows AKD converges to a closed-form expression involving oblique projections and contraction matrices.\n- **Limitation**: Performance degrades over rounds due to mismatched data/models.\n\n> *Figure 1–3 illustrate AKD flow, geometric intuition, and ensemble construction.*\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Averaged Knowledge Distillation (AvgKD)**\n\n- **Algorithm**: Similar to AKD, but agents average their models after exchange.\n- **Proposition III**: AvgKD converges to a stable limit (unlike AKD), but it’s not optimal.\n- **Advantage**: More stable than AKD; doesn’t degrade with more rounds.\n- **Disadvantage**: Doesn't reach centralized performance.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Ensembled Knowledge Distillation (EKD)**\n\n- **Idea**: Run two parallel AKD processes (starting from each agent), then combine predictions alternately:\n  \n  ```\n  f∞(𝐱) = Σ_{t=0}^∞ (-1)^t (g_t¹(𝐱) + g_t²(𝐱))\n  ```\n\n- **Proposition IV**: EKD recovers the optimal global model `g†*`, preventing degeneracy.\n- **Cost**: Requires large ensembles → computationally expensive.\n\n---\n\n## 📊 **Experiments**\n\n### Toy Experiments\n- **Linear regression problem**: Ax* = b\n- **Results**: AvgKD outperforms AKD in heterogeneous settings; AKD fails with high heterogeneity.\n\n### Real-World Experiments (MNIST & CIFAR10)\n- Use neural networks with varying levels of data heterogeneity controlled by hyperparameter **Alpha**:\n  - Alpha = 0 → i.i.d. data\n  - Alpha = 1 → completely non-i.i.d. split\n\n#### Key Findings:\n- **AvgKD > AKD**: AvgKD stabilizes performance regardless of heterogeneity; AKD degrades faster.\n- **EKD matches centralized accuracy** in synthetic settings, but improvement is slow or nonexistent on real datasets (CIFAR10), possibly due to models operating near NTK regime.\n- **Data heterogeneity is the main bottleneck**: Mismatch between agents' data causes information loss during distillation → faster degradation.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **Results Summary**\n\n| Method     | Stability | Convergence | Centralized Accuracy | Cost          |\n|------------|-----------|-------------|----------------------|---------------|\n| AKD        | ❌ Degrades | ✅ Yes       | ❌ No                 | Low           |\n| AvgKD      | ✅ Stable   | ✅ Yes       | ❌ No                 | Low           |\n| EKD        | ✅ Stable   | ✅ Optimal   | ✅ Matches            | High (ensemble)|\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 **Conclusion**\n\n- **AvgKD** is practical and robust under heterogeneity.\n- **EKD** theoretically achieves optimal performance but is costly.\n- **Data heterogeneity** is the primary challenge — mismatches lead to information loss.\n- These methods enable **model-agnostic FL**, allowing agents to use different architectures while still benefiting from collaborative learning.\n\n---\n\n## 🏷️ Affiliations\n- École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)\n- University of California, Berkeley\n\n---\n\nThis work advances federated learning by introducing flexible, theory-grounded distillation schemes that handle both model and data heterogeneity — critical for real-world deployment.\n\n---\n",

    "llm_output_test3": "summary: \n## Summary 1\n\nThis article from **CNN (Washington)** reports on **President George W. Bush’s efforts to reframe the public and political debate over the Iraq War** by drawing historical parallels — particularly with **Vietnam**, but also with **Japan after WWII** and the **Korean War** — in anticipation of a crucial progress report from General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker.\n\n---\n\n### 📌 Key Points:\n\n#### 1. **Bush’s Vietnam Analogy – A Reversal of Narrative**\n- Bush is attempting to **flip the script** on comparisons between Iraq and Vietnam.\n- Instead of acknowledging Vietnam as a cautionary tale against prolonged war, he argues that **withdrawing from Vietnam had dire humanitarian consequences** — citing “boat people,” “re-education camps,” and “killing fields.”\n- He claims that **U.S. withdrawal damaged American credibility**, which **emboldened terrorists like Osama bin Laden**, who allegedly believed Americans would rise up against the Iraq War just as they did against Vietnam.\n\n> *“The price of America's withdrawal [from Vietnam] was paid by millions of innocent citizens.”*\n\n#### 2. **Historical Comparisons: Japan & Korea**\n- Bush will invoke **post-WWII Japan** to argue that skeptics once doubted whether Japan could become democratic — yet today it thrives as a free society.\n- He’ll reference the **Korean War**, where critics called U.S. involvement futile or divisive — but asserts that **America kept its word**, helping South Korea avoid repression.\n\n> *“Without America’s intervention... millions of South Koreans would now be living under a brutal and repressive regime.”*\n\nThese analogies aim to suggest that **staying the course in Iraq**, despite criticism, may lead to long-term stability and freedom — just as it did in Asia decades ago.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Political Backlash & Public Opinion**\n- **Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D)** sharply criticizes Bush for misleading the public into war under false pretenses and calls Iraq “one of the worst foreign policy blunders.”\n- Reid urges Congress to change direction in Iraq this fall.\n- **Public sentiment remains overwhelmingly negative**: \n   - 64% oppose the war.\n   - 72% say even positive reports won’t change their minds.\n   - 53% distrust Petraeus’ upcoming assessment.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Strategic Timing & Context**\n- The speech comes ahead of **Petraeus-Crocker’s September report**, which Bush has repeatedly urged people to wait for before making judgments.\n- The White House sees these speeches (including one to the American Legion next week) as part of an effort to **provide “broader context”** for evaluating Iraq’s progress.\n- Defense Secretary Gates has said he’ll wait for the report before deciding on troop drawdowns.\n\n---\n\n### 🧭 Analysis:\nBush is clearly trying to **shift the narrative away from current failures** in Iraq toward **long-term strategic vision and historical precedent**. By invoking past U.S. interventions — especially those that ultimately succeeded — he seeks to justify continued commitment despite mounting casualties, costs, and public disillusionment.\n\nHowever, his use of Vietnam as a warning against withdrawal rather than as a lesson in avoiding quagmires is controversial and likely to face strong pushback — both from Democrats and from segments of the public who view Vietnam as a symbol of misguided military engagement.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Summary:\n> In a bid to defend his Iraq strategy ahead of a key military report, President Bush draws controversial historical parallels — notably comparing Iraq to Vietnam, Japan, and Korea — arguing that staying engaged leads to long-term stability, while withdrawal invites chaos and undermines U.S. credibility. But with public support waning and Democratic leaders condemning the war as a failed venture based on deception, Bush’s rhetorical pivot faces steep political headwinds.\n\n--- \n\n📌 **Bottom Line**: This is not just about policy — it’s about **narrative control**. Bush is trying to redefine what \"success\" looks like in Iraq by anchoring it in history, hoping to buy time until Petraeus’ report arrives — and perhaps sway opinion before Congress acts. Whether it works depends largely on whether Americans are willing to accept his version of history — and trust his interpretation of the future.\n\n---\n\n## Summary 2\n\nThis research poster, titled **“Viewing Transformers Through the Lens of Long Convolutions Layers”** by Itamar Zimerman and Lior Wolf from Tel Aviv University, investigates why long convolutional layers (like S4, Mega, SGConv) outperform standard Transformers on long-range sequence modeling tasks — such as speech classification, document understanding, and DNA modeling.\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 **Background & Motivation**\n\n- **Long-Conv layers** (e.g., state-space models, CKConv, Hyena) excel at modeling long-range dependencies.\n- The authors aim to understand **why Transformers underperform** in comparison.\n- They explore three potential bottlenecks:\n  1. **Expressiveness**: Can Transformers model complex long-range patterns? → *Theorem B.1 shows one self-attention head can express a state-space layer channel.*\n  2. **Optimization**: Do training issues limit performance? → *Results improve with more data, suggesting optimization isn’t the main bottleneck.*\n  3. **Inductive Bias**: Is the lack of built-in smoothness/locality the key issue?\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 **Method: Local and Smooth (LaS) Attention**\n\nTo address the inductive bias gap, they propose **LaS Attention**, which modifies the attention mechanism to mimic properties of long convolutions:\n\n- Applies **1D average pooling** across rows of the attention matrix → promotes **smoothness**.\n- Introduces **exponential decay** based on positional distance → enhances **locality**.\n\n> ✅ Result: LaS Attention learns **more continuous attention matrices**, visually smoother than vanilla attention (see heatmaps comparing Layer-10).\n\n---\n\n### 📊 **Results**\n\n#### 1. **Long Range Arena (LRA) Benchmark**\nLaS Attention significantly improves Transformer performance across all LRA tasks:\n\n| Model              | ListOps | Text   | Retrieval | Image  | Pathfinder |\n|--------------------|---------|--------|-----------|--------|------------|\n| Transformer        | 36.37   | 64.27  | 57.46     | 42.44  | 71.40      |\n| **LaS (ours)**     | **53.05** | **79.28** | **85.56** | **70.44** | **81.62** |\n\nEven outperforms many specialized architectures like Reformer, Linformer, BigBird, Performer, and Luna-256.\n\n#### 2. **Language Modeling (Text8 & Enwik8)**\nLaS Attention also improves small-scale language modeling, achieving lower perplexity:\n\n| Model             | Text8    | Enwik8   |\n|-------------------|----------|----------|\n| Vanilla Attention | 1.3557   | 1.2885   |\n| **LaS Attention** | **1.3332** | **1.2826** |\n\nTraining curves show faster convergence and better final performance.\n\n---\n\n### 🎯 **Conclusions**\n\n- **Understanding Long Convolutions**: Their success stems from built-in **inductive biases** — smoothness and locality — that are missing in vanilla Transformers.\n- **LaS-Attention**: A simple architectural modification that injects these biases into Transformers, **closing the performance gap** on long-range tasks without requiring new architectures or massive compute.\n\n---\n\n### 💡 Takeaway\n\nTransformers aren't inherently bad at long-range modeling — they just lack the right **inductive biases**. By borrowing ideas from successful convolutional approaches (smoothness + locality), we can enhance them effectively.\n\nThis work bridges the gap between convolutional and attention-based models, offering a practical path to improve Transformers for long-sequence applications.\n\n---\n"

In the past, we meet **Ye Wenjie**, a brilliant astrophysicist whose life is shattered by political persecution during the 1960s. After witnessing her father’s brutal death at the hands of Red Guards, Ye becomes disillusioned with humanity. Later recruited into a top-secret military project called **Red Coast Base**, she makes a fateful decision: to send a signal into deep space, inviting extraterrestrial civilizations to Earth — hoping they might be better stewards than humans.\n\nMeanwhile, in the present day, nanomaterials researcher **Wang Miao** becomes entangled in a mysterious conspiracy after scientists begin dying under unexplained circumstances. He’s drawn into a virtual reality game called *Three Body*, which simulates a planet orbiting three suns — a chaotic system where civilizations rise and fall unpredictably due to erratic climate swings. The game isn’t just entertainment; it’s a recruitment tool for a secret organization known as the **Frontiers of Science**, which secretly worships the alien civilization Ye contacted — the Trisolarans.\n\nAs Wang digs deeper, he uncovers the truth: the Trisolarans are real, their world is dying, and they’re coming to Earth — not as peaceful explorers, but as invaders seeking to colonize our planet. Their home world orbits three stars in an unstable gravitational dance — the “three-body problem” of celestial mechanics — making survival nearly impossible. Earth, with its stable single sun, is their salvation.\n\nThe novel masterfully balances hard science with human drama. It explores themes of cosmic insignificance, moral ambiguity, and the fragility of civilization. Ye Wenjie’s tragic arc forces us to ask: If humanity is flawed beyond redemption, do we deserve to survive? And if aliens offer salvation — or destruction — what does that say about our own nature?\n\nLiu Cixin doesn’t just deliver alien invasion tropes — he redefines them. The Trisolarans aren’t cartoonish villains; they’re desperate survivors. Their technology dwarfs ours, yet their society is rigid, emotionless, and terrifyingly logical. When they arrive, it won’t be with spaceships and lasers — but with subtle sabotage, psychological warfare, and a chilling ultimatum: surrender… or be eradicated.\n\nBy the end, *The Three-Body Problem* leaves you breathless — not just from the scale of its ideas, but from the existential dread it evokes. Humanity stands on the precipice, facing not only an alien threat, but the mirror of its own failures. As one character muses: “The universe is a dark forest. Every civilization is an armed hunter… stepping through the trees, trying to stay silent.”\n\nThis isn’t just science fiction — it’s a warning, a meditation, and a masterpiece that reshapes how we think about humanity’s place in the cosmos.\n\n⏱️ *Time to read: ~3 minutes | Word count: ~650*\n\n---\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n- Dual timelines: Ye Wenjie’s tragic past + Wang Miao’s present-day mystery.\n- The “Three-Body Problem” refers to the chaotic orbital mechanics of Trisolaris — a dying world orbiting three suns.\n- First contact isn’t friendly — it’s a calculated invasion by a desperate alien species.\n- Themes: Cosmic horror, moral decay, scientific ethics, and the cost of hope.\n- A genre-defining novel that launched the global success of Chinese sci-fi.\n\nNow go — before the sophons find you. 🌌",

    "llm_output_test2": "result: **3-Minute Speed-Read Summary: *One Hundred Years of Solitude* by Gabriel García Márquez**\n\nIn 1967, Colombian literary giant Gabriel García Márquez published *One Hundred Years of Solitude* — a masterpiece that blends magical realism with epic family drama, chronicling the rise and fall of the Buendía dynasty in the mythical town of Macondo.\n\nThe story begins with José Arcadio Buendía and his wife, Úrsula Iguarán, fleeing their hometown after José kills a neighbor in a duel. They journey into the jungle and found Macondo — a secluded Eden-like village, untouched by time or outside influence. The town becomes a microcosm of Latin American history, reflecting colonization, civil war, foreign exploitation, and political turmoil — all through the lens of the eccentric, passionate, and doomed Buendía family.\n\nOver seven generations, the Buendías repeat names, fates, and flaws. Men named José Arcadio are impulsive and wild; those named Aureliano are introspective and often revolutionary. Women like Úrsula — the matriarch who lives over a century — hold the family together, while others succumb to madness, lust, or solitude. Love stories bloom and die. Rivalries ignite. Wars rage. A banana company arrives, brings prosperity, then departs — leaving behind a massacre of striking workers that the government denies ever happened.\n\nMagic is woven into daily life: yellow butterflies follow lovers, a child is born with a pig’s tail, a woman ascends to heaven while folding laundry, and rain falls for four years straight. These surreal moments aren’t distractions — they’re reflections of how reality and myth intertwine in Latin America, and how memory, fate, and isolation shape identity.\n\nThe novel’s central theme? **Solitude.** Each Buendía, despite being surrounded by family, ends up emotionally isolated — trapped by their own obsessions, regrets, or inherited curses. The town itself mirrors this: once vibrant, it becomes forgotten, corrupted, and eventually erased from existence.\n\nThe climax comes when the last Buendía — Aureliano Babilonia — deciphers the prophetic parchments left by the gypsy Melquíades. He realizes the entire family’s history was foretold — and that Macondo’s end is inevitable. As he reads the final line, a hurricane obliterates the town, “leaving a completely flat, empty space with no sign that there was ever anything there.” García Márquez doesn’t just end the story — he erases it.\n\nYet, amid destruction, there’s beauty. The novel celebrates fleeting joy — love, laughter, creativity — even as it acknowledges their impermanence. It’s not a tragedy, but a meditation: on cycles, memory, legacy, and the human need to connect — even when we’re destined to be alone.\n\n**Why it matters:**  \n*One Hundred Years of Solitude* redefined world literature. It popularized magical realism, gave voice to Latin American identity, and showed how personal and political histories are inseparable. Its cyclical structure, rich symbolism, and haunting prose make it timeless — a novel where every character, event, and detail echoes across generations, reminding us that history repeats — unless we remember it.\n\nSo if you read nothing else — remember this:  \n> *“Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.”*\n\nThat opening line — simple, poetic, full of mystery — sets the tone for everything that follows: a tale of wonder, sorrow, repetition… and the quiet, enduring power of memory.\n\n---\n\n⏱️ *Time’s up. You’ve just absorbed 100 years of magic, madness, and meaning — in 3 minutes.*",

    "llm_output_test3": "result: **3-Minute Speed-Read Summary: *Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils* by Jin Yong**\n\nJin Yong’s *Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils* (天龙八部) — one of his most ambitious, intricate wuxia epics — weaves together fate, identity, loyalty, and tragedy across three intertwined protagonists: **Qiao Feng**, **Duan Yu**, and **Xuzhu**. Serialized from 1963 to 1966, this masterpiece explores the chaos of love, war, and cultural conflict during the Song Dynasty era.\n\n---\n\n**The Three Heroes:**\n\n1. **Qiao Feng** – The noble, heroic leader of the Beggar Sect, beloved for his strength and integrity. But when rumors surface that he is actually a Khitan (a sworn enemy of the Song), he’s cast out — not just from his sect, but from society itself. His quest to uncover his true origins becomes a tragic journey of self-discovery, culminating in exile and ultimate sacrifice. He embodies the novel’s core theme: *the pain of being misunderstood and betrayed by those you protect.*\n\n2. **Duan Yu** – A spoiled, pacifist prince of Dali who stumbles into martial arts mastery through sheer luck (and coincidences that frustrate even his teachers). He’s hopelessly infatuated with the beautiful Wang Yuyan — only to discover she loves his rival, Murong Fu. By novel’s end, Duan Yu learns he’s not even biologically a Dali prince — freeing him to marry Wang Yuyan, who finally chooses him over her obsession with Murong Fu. His arc is comedic, romantic, and deeply human.\n\n3. **Xuzhu** – A naive, gentle monk from Shaolin who accidentally breaks monastic vows and inherits immense power from two legendary masters. His innocence contrasts sharply with the political machinations around him. He ends up leading the powerful Jiu Mo Sect and marrying the fierce Princess Meng, proving that kindness can triumph in a world of violence.\n\n---\n\n**Themes & Structure:**\n\nThe title *Tian Long Ba Bu* refers to the Eight Classes of Buddhist Devas — symbolic of the novel’s eight major characters or factions, each representing different aspects of human nature: pride, desire, loyalty, vengeance, delusion. Jin Yong uses this framework to explore how fate binds these characters — enemies become allies, lovers are torn apart, identities are shattered.\n\nThe novel spans multiple kingdoms — Song, Liao, Dali, Western Xia — highlighting the tension between ethnic groups and the futility of war. Loyalty is questioned, love is unrequited, and justice is rarely served. Even the “villains” have depth — like the Iron Clown, who commits suicide in despair after a cruel twist of fate.\n\n---\n\n**Ending & Legacy:**\n\nWhile Duan Yu finds happiness, Qiao Feng’s ending is heartbreakingly noble — sacrificing himself to prevent war between Song and Liao. Xuzhu finds peace in unexpected love and leadership. The story doesn’t offer easy victories; instead, it offers profound reflections on identity, duty, and compassion.\n\nConsidered one of Jin Yong’s greatest works — often compared to *The Lord of the Rings* in Chinese literature — *Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils* remains a cultural touchstone, adapted countless times for TV, film, and games. Its emotional depth, philosophical weight, and thrilling martial arts sequences make it essential reading for fans of epic storytelling.\n\n---\n\n**In 3 Minutes:**\nThree heroes. One destiny. Betrayal, love, loss, redemption. Jin Yong at his most complex — where every character’s struggle mirrors the soul of a nation. A tale as timeless as the gods and demons it’s named for.\n\n**Final Thought:** In a world where no one is purely divine or demonic — everyone is just… human."

Analysis & Improvement Suggestions\n\nThank you for providing the **Residential Lease Agreement** and the **Security Deposit Return Review Checkpoints**. As the **Reviewing Party (Tenant)** in the **House Rental Industry**, your primary concern is to ensure that the security deposit clause — and related provisions — are **fair, legally compliant, transparent, and enforceable** under state/local law.\n\nBelow is a **detailed risk assessment and improvement suggestions** based on each of the 12 Security Deposit Return Checkpoints.\n\n---\n\n# 🚨 OVERALL RISK ASSESSMENT\n\nThe current lease agreement contains **significant risks to the Tenant**, particularly regarding **security deposit return**. Key issues include:\n\n- **Vague or missing definitions** of “normal wear and tear,” “damage,” and “clean condition.”\n- **No deadline** for returning the deposit after move-out.\n- **No requirement for itemized statements or supporting documentation**.\n- **Non-refundable portion of deposit** without clear legal justification.\n- **No dispute resolution mechanism** or tenant recourse if deductions are wrongful.\n- **No mention of interest or holding requirements** (critical in many states).\n- **No joint move-out inspection process** or pre-move-out walkthrough option.\n- **Unilateral landlord discretion** over deposit use and deductions.\n- **Failure to reference state/local laws**, which may override these terms.\n\n> ✅ **Bottom Line**: The current clause favors the Landlord excessively and exposes the Tenant to potential **unlawful withholding**, **lack of transparency**, and **limited recourse**.\n\n---\n\n# 🔍 DETAILED REVIEW BY CHECKPOINT\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **1. Deposit Amount & Legal Limits**\n\n### ❗ Risk:\n- Deposit amount field is blank → no clarity on how much is being paid.\n- No mention of compliance with state/local limits (e.g., max 1–2 months’ rent).\n- Clause allows for **non-refundable portion** ($______) — this may be **illegal in many jurisdictions** unless clearly disclosed as a *pet fee*, *cleaning fee*, or similar *non-security* charge.\n\n### 💡 Improvement Suggestions:\n- **Fill in exact deposit amount** and ensure it complies with local law (e.g., CA = 2x rent for unfurnished; NY = 1x rent).\n- **Remove or reclassify “non-refundable” portion** — if intended as a cleaning fee, label it separately and cap at reasonable market rate.\n- Add:  \n  > “The security deposit shall not exceed [X] months’ rent as permitted by [State] law.”\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **2. Purpose & Permissible Deductions**\n\n### ❗ Risk:\n- Vague language: “damages caused by Tenant... other than reasonable wear and tear.”\n- No definition of “reasonable wear and tear” → opens door to arbitrary deductions.\n- No prohibition on deducting for routine maintenance or cosmetic updates (e.g., repainting walls).\n\n### 💡 Improvement Suggestions:\n- Define “normal wear and tear” explicitly:  \n  > “Normal wear and tear includes minor scuffs, faded paint from sun exposure, worn carpet from regular foot traffic, etc., but excludes damage resulting from negligence, abuse, or failure to maintain.”\n- Prohibit deductions for:  \n  > “Routine maintenance, depreciation, or cosmetic updates required due to age or natural deterioration.”\n- Add:  \n  > “Landlord shall not deduct for repairs necessitated by normal aging or ordinary use of the Premises.”\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **3. Deadline for Return**\n\n### ❗ Risk:\n- **NO DEADLINE** specified for returning deposit after move-out → violates most state laws (typically 14–30 days).\n- No penalty or interest for late return → gives Landlord unlimited time to withhold funds.\n\n### 💡 Improvement Suggestions:\n- Insert specific timeframe aligned with state law (e.g., 21 days in CA, 30 days in TX):  \n  > “Landlord shall return the security deposit, less any lawful deductions, within [XX] days after Tenant vacates the Premises and returns keys.”\n- Add penalty clause:  \n  > “If Landlord fails to return the deposit or provide an itemized statement within the required timeframe, Tenant shall be entitled to [statutory penalty] or [double deposit amount], whichever is greater, plus attorney’s fees.”\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **4. Itemized Statement Requirement**\n\n### ❗ Risk:\n- No requirement for itemized statement or supporting evidence (photos, receipts).\n- Allows Landlord to make arbitrary deductions without proof.\n\n### 💡 Improvement Suggestions:\n- Require:  \n  > “Landlord shall provide Tenant with a written, itemized statement of all deductions, including descriptions of damages, costs incurred, and copies of invoices or photographs substantiating each deduction.”\n- Specify delivery method:  \n  > “Such statement shall be sent via certified mail or email with read receipt to Tenant’s last known address.”\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **5. Move-Out Inspection Process**\n\n### ❗ Risk:\n- No provision for **joint move-out inspection**.\n- No opportunity for **pre-move-out walkthrough** to fix issues before final departure.\n- No timeline for inspections or notice periods.\n\n### 💡 Improvement Suggestions:\n- Add:  \n  > “Within 7 days prior to termination, Tenant may request a joint move-out inspection with Landlord to identify any needed repairs or cleaning. Landlord shall notify Tenant in writing of any deficiencies found during such inspection, allowing Tenant up to 5 business days to correct them.”\n- Include:  \n  > “A final walk-through shall occur within 24 hours of Tenant’s surrender of possession, with both parties present unless otherwise agreed.”\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **6. Dispute Resolution Mechanism**\n\n### ❗ Risk:\n- No formal process for disputing deductions.\n- No requirement to notify Tenant before making deductions.\n- No right to contest before final disbursement.\n\n### 💡 Improvement Suggestions:\n- Add:  \n  > “Before retaining any portion of the deposit, Landlord shall send Tenant a preliminary itemized statement detailing proposed deductions. Tenant shall have 10 days to respond in writing with objections or evidence challenging the deductions.”\n- Include dispute resolution path:  \n  > “If Tenant disputes deductions, either party may initiate mediation or file suit in small claims court. Tenant shall be entitled to recover attorney’s fees if successful.”\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **7. Interest & Holding Requirements**\n\n### ❗ Risk:\n- No mention of whether deposit earns interest (required in some states like MA, NY, WI).\n- No requirement to hold deposit in separate account.\n- No disclosure of where deposit is held.\n\n### 💡 Improvement Suggestions:\n- Add:  \n  > “If required by applicable law, Landlord shall deposit the security deposit into an interest-bearing account within [X] days of receipt. Any earned interest shall accrue to Tenant’s benefit.”\n- Require disclosure:  \n  > “Landlord shall disclose in writing the name and location of the financial institution holding the deposit within 10 days of receipt.”\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **8. Landlord’s Obligations Upon Transfer/Sale**\n\n### ❗ Risk:\n- No clause addressing what happens if property is sold or transferred.\n- Tenant could lose deposit if new owner refuses to honor it.\n\n### 💡 Improvement Suggestions:\n- Add:  \n  > “In the event of sale or transfer of the Premises, Landlord shall either refund the full security deposit to Tenant or transfer the deposit to the new owner, who shall assume responsibility for its return upon termination of tenancy. Failure to do so shall constitute breach of this Agreement.”\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **9. Tenant’s Right to Withhold Rent or Repair**\n\n### ❗ Risk:\n- Contract prohibits withholding rent without consent — fair.\n- But lacks exception for **emergency repairs** that may impact deposit (e.g., leaky roof causing mold).\n\n### 💡 Improvement Suggestions:\n- Clarify emergency rights:  \n  > “Notwithstanding any provision herein, Tenant may perform necessary emergency repairs to prevent imminent damage to the Premises or personal injury, provided Tenant notifies Landlord immediately and submits receipts for reimbursement. Such repairs shall not result in deposit deductions unless caused by Tenant’s negligence.”\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **10. Documentation & Communication**\n\n### ❗ Risk:\n- No requirement to keep move-in/move-out condition reports.\n- No attached checklist or photo documentation.\n\n### 💡 Improvement Suggestions:\n- Attach **Move-In/Move-Out Condition Report** as Exhibit A.\n- Require dated photos/video walkthroughs at both move-in and move-out.\n- Add:  \n  > “Both Parties shall sign and date the Move-In Condition Report within 7 days of occupancy. Failure to do so shall result in presumption that Premises were in ‘good condition’ at move-in.”\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **11. Penalties for Non-Compliance**\n\n### ❗ Risk:\n- No statutory penalties or liquidated damages for wrongful withholding.\n- Attorney’s fees only available to prevailing party — doesn’t incentivize compliance.\n\n### 💡 Improvement Suggestions:\n- Add:  \n  > “If Landlord wrongfully withholds any portion of the security deposit, Tenant shall be entitled to recover triple the amount wrongfully withheld, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs.”\n- Align with state statute (e.g., CA Civil Code § 1950.5(d)).\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **12. Jurisdiction-Specific Compliance**\n\n### ❗ Risk:\n- Entire contract lacks reference to governing state/local laws.\n- May contain unenforceable clauses under local ordinances (e.g., NYC requires 14-day return, SF bans non-refundable deposits).\n\n### 💡 Improvement Suggestions:\n- Add jurisdictional compliance clause:  \n  > “This Agreement shall be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws of [State], including all applicable city, county, and municipal ordinances relating to residential rentals and security deposits.”\n- Encourage Tenant to consult local tenant rights organization or attorney before signing.\n\n---\n\n# 📌 ADDITIONAL RED FLAGS IN THE LEASE (BEYOND DEPOSIT)\n\nWhile focused on deposit, here are **other high-risk clauses** affecting Tenant:\n\n| Clause | Issue | Suggestion |\n|--------|-------|------------|\n| **“As-is” acceptance** | Tenant accepts premises “as-is” — may waive right to claim pre-existing defects | Add: “Except for latent defects unknown to Tenant at move-in.” |\n| **Mold Waiver (Section 23)** | Unfairly releases Landlord from liability for mold — often illegal | Strike or amend: “Landlord remains liable for mold caused by structural defects or failure to maintain plumbing.” |\n| **No Alterations Allowed** | Too broad — even hanging pictures requires permission | Amend: “Minor cosmetic alterations (e.g., nail holes for pictures) allowed; Tenant responsible for patching/painting upon move-out.” |\n| **Entry Without Notice (Emergency Only)** | Good, but vague | Clarify: “Emergency means fire, flood, gas leak, or immediate threat to safety.” |\n| **Abandonment Definition** | Overly harsh — 1 day absence + removal of belongings = abandonment | Revise: “Abandonment occurs only after 30 days of continuous absence AND non-payment of rent.” |\n\n---\n\n# ✍️ SAMPLE REVISIONS TO SECURITY DEPOSIT CLAUSE\n\nReplace current “DEPOSIT” section with this improved version:\n\n---\n\n### 🔧 REVISED SECURITY DEPOSIT SECTION\n\n**DEPOSIT:**  \nAt the signing of this Agreement, Tenant shall deposit with Landlord a security deposit in the amount of **$_________**, which shall not exceed the maximum allowed under [State] law. This deposit shall serve solely as security for: (i) payment of rent and other charges due under this Agreement; (ii) repair of damage to the Premises beyond normal wear and tear; and (iii) restoration of the Premises to the condition existing at move-in, excluding ordinary wear and tear.\n\n**Normal Wear and Tear Defined:**  \n“Normal wear and tear” includes minor scuff marks on walls, faded paint from sunlight, worn carpet from regular foot traffic, and similar conditions arising from ordinary use. It does **not** include damage caused by negligence, abuse, unauthorized alterations, pet damage, or failure to maintain the Premises.\n\n**Non-Refundable Fees:**  \nAny non-refundable fees (e.g., cleaning, pet, or administrative fees) must be clearly labeled and capped at reasonable market rates. No portion of the security deposit may be designated as non-refundable unless expressly permitted by state law.\n\n**Return Timeline:**  \nLandlord shall return the full security deposit, less any lawful deductions, within **[XX]** days after Tenant surrenders possession of the Premises and returns all keys. If deductions are made, Landlord shall provide Tenant with a written, itemized statement of deductions, including detailed descriptions, costs, and supporting documentation (photographs, receipts, invoices), delivered via certified mail or email with read receipt.\n\n**Dispute Rights:**  \nTenant has 10 days to object in writing to any deductions. If unresolved, either party may pursue mediation or small claims court. If Tenant prevails, Landlord shall pay statutory penalties, attorney’s fees, and court costs.\n\n**Interest & Holding:**  \nIf required by law, Landlord shall place the deposit in an interest-bearing account within 10 days of receipt. Earned interest shall accrue to Tenant’s benefit. Landlord shall disclose the name and location of the financial institution holding the deposit.\n\n**Transfer of Property:**  \nUpon sale or transfer of the Premises, Landlord shall either refund the deposit to Tenant or transfer it to the new owner, who assumes responsibility for its return. Failure to do so constitutes breach.\n\n**Penalty for Wrongful Withholding:**  \nIf Landlord wrongfully withholds any portion of the deposit, Tenant shall be entitled to recover **triple the amount wrongfully withheld**, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs, as permitted by [State] law.\n\n---\n\n# ✅ FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TENANT\n\n1. **DO NOT SIGN** until deposit clause is revised per above.\n2. **Demand completion of Move-In Condition Report** with dated photos/video.\n3. **Consult local tenant union or legal aid** — many offer free review services.\n4. **Keep all communication in writing** — text messages, emails, letters.\n5. **Document everything** — take photos/videos at move-in and move-out.\n6. **Request bank details** where deposit is held (if required by law).\n7. **Know your state’s landlord-tenant code** — e.g., California Civil Code § 1950.5, New York RPAPL § 711, Texas Prop Code § 92.107.\n\n---\n\n# 📄 ATTACHMENTS TO REQUEST\n\n✅ **Exhibit A: Move-In/Move-Out Condition Report** (with photos)  \n✅ **Exhibit B: Sample Itemized Deduction Statement Template**  \n✅ **Exhibit C: Local Security Deposit Law Summary Sheet**\n\n---\n\n# ⚖️ LEGAL DISCLAIMER\n\nThis analysis is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice.

    "llm_output_test2": "result: # Contract Risk Review Report\n\n## 1. Basic Information\n- **Reviewing Party:** Recipient\n- **Industry/Field:** Confidentiality Agreement\n\n## 2. Analysis & Improvement Suggestions\n\nThank you for providing the **Confidential Disclosure Agreement (CDA)** and the detailed **Review Checkpoints** focused on **Duration of Confidentiality**. As the **Reviewing Party (Recipient)** — in this case, **Harvard** — we must ensure that the confidentiality obligations are **reasonable, enforceable, and aligned with Harvard’s institutional interests**, while also complying with applicable law and minimizing unnecessary long-term liabilities.\n\nBelow is a **comprehensive risk assessment and improvement suggestions** based on each of the 12 checkpoints, tailored to Harvard’s position as Recipient.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ OVERALL ASSESSMENT\n\nThe agreement contains a **clearly defined duration clause** (Section 8), which states:\n\n> *“The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and expire on the date that is two (2) years later... In any event, the Receiving Party’s non-disclosure and non-use obligations... shall not expire until the date that is five (5) years after the Effective Date.”*\n\nThis structure is **generally acceptable** but presents **several risks and ambiguities** that should be addressed to protect Harvard’s interests, particularly given its status as an academic/research institution that may need to publish or share information under certain conditions.\n\n---\n\n# 🔍 DETAILED REVIEW BY CHECKPOINT\n\n---\n\n### **1. Explicit Timeframe Defined**\n\n✅ **Compliant**: The agreement explicitly states:\n- Contract term: **2 years**\n- Survival of confidentiality obligations: **5 years from Effective Date**\n\n⚠️ **Risk**: The 5-year survival period applies regardless of when disclosure occurred. If disclosures happen near the end of the 2-year term, Harvard remains bound for nearly 5 full years — potentially longer than necessary for less sensitive information.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:\n> Add language limiting the survival period to **5 years from the date of disclosure** (not Effective Date) for each piece of Confidential Information. This aligns better with industry best practices and reduces overreach.\n>\n> *Example*:  \n> “The Receiving Party’s obligations under Sections 3 and 5 shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement for a period of five (5) years from the date of disclosure of each item of Confidential Information.”\n\n---\n\n### **2. Post-Term Survival Clause**\n\n✅ **Compliant**: Section 8 clearly states that confidentiality obligations survive beyond contract termination (“shall not expire until... five (5) years after the Effective Date”).\n\n⚠️ **Risk**: No distinction between types of information (e.g., trade secrets vs. general info). Also, no carve-out for information that becomes public during the survival period.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:\n> Clarify that survival obligations apply only to information that remains confidential at the time of disclosure and does not become publicly available through no fault of Harvard.\n>\n> *Example*:  \n> “Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party’s obligations shall terminate with respect to any Confidential Information that becomes publicly available through no fault of the Receiving Party.”\n\n---\n\n### **3. Evergreen or Perpetual Clauses**\n\n✅ **Not Applicable**: No perpetual clause exists — good.\n\n⚠️ **Risk**: None here, since term is finite. However, if future amendments add indefinite terms, Harvard should resist unless dealing with true trade secrets.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:\n> Insert a clause affirming that **no provision shall be interpreted to create perpetual obligations**, except where required by law (e.g., trade secret protection under DTSA/UTSA).\n>\n> *Example*:  \n> “Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to impose obligations beyond those permitted by applicable law, including but not limited to the Uniform Trade Secrets Act or Defend Trade Secrets Act.”\n\n---\n\n### **4. Event-Based Termination Triggers**\n\n✅ Partially Compliant: The definition of Confidential Information includes exceptions for publicly known info (Section 2(iv)), but **no explicit event-based trigger for ending obligations** beyond the 5-year term.\n\n⚠️ **Risk**: Ambiguity around what constitutes “publicly known.” Does it include accidental leaks? What if information enters public domain via independent research?\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:\n> Define “publicly known” more precisely and add a mechanism for mutual acknowledgment or notice upon such occurrence.\n>\n> *Example*:  \n> “‘Publicly known’ means information that has been published or otherwise made generally available to the public without restriction, other than through breach of this Agreement, and is accessible to persons skilled in the relevant field. Upon reasonable belief that Confidential Information has become publicly known, either party may provide written notice to the other, and the receiving party’s obligations shall cease with respect to such information.”\n\n---\n\n### **5. Trade Secrets vs. General Confidential Information**\n\n❌ **Non-Compliant**: The agreement does **not distinguish** between general confidential information and trade secrets. It treats all Confidential Information uniformly under a 5-year term.\n\n⚠️ **Risk**: Under U.S. law (DTSA/UTSA), **trade secrets can be protected indefinitely** — but only if they remain secret. A fixed 5-year term could inadvertently waive protections for true trade secrets disclosed late in the term.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:\n> Add a separate clause preserving trade secret protections beyond the contractual term.\n>\n> *Example*:  \n> “To the extent any Confidential Information qualifies as a trade secret under applicable law (including the Defend Trade Secrets Act or Uniform Trade Secrets Act), the Receiving Party’s obligations shall continue indefinitely so long as such information remains a trade secret, subject to the exceptions set forth in Section 2.”\n\n---\n\n### **6. Jurisdictional Compliance**\n\n✅ **Partially Compliant**: Governing law is Massachusetts (Section 10), which follows UTSA and allows reasonable NDA terms. Courts in MA have upheld multi-year NDAs.\n\n⚠️ **Risk**: Some jurisdictions (e.g., California) limit NDA durations for employee-related disclosures. While not directly applicable here, Harvard may interact with entities in restrictive states.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:\n> Include a severability clause that allows courts to modify overly broad or unreasonable terms rather than voiding them entirely.\n>\n> *Example*:  \n> “If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect, and the court shall construe the invalid provision to reflect the parties’ intent to the greatest extent possible.”\n\n---\n\n### **7. Renewal or Extension Provisions**\n\n❌ **Non-Compliant**: No mention of renewal or extension mechanisms.\n\n⚠️ **Risk**: If collaboration extends beyond 2 years, Harvard may still be bound for 5 years — even if discussions cease. No flexibility to renegotiate.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:\n> Allow mutual extension of confidentiality obligations if new disclosures occur after initial term.\n>\n> *Example*:  \n> “The parties may mutually agree in writing to extend the confidentiality obligations beyond the original five (5) year term for any newly disclosed Confidential Information.”\n\n---\n\n### **8. Return or Destruction Clause Alignment**\n\n✅ **Compliant**: Section 8 requires return/destruction upon termination or request, with exception for one archival copy.\n\n⚠️ **Risk**: No requirement for **certification of destruction** — leaves room for dispute.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:\n> Require written certification upon destruction or return.\n>\n> *Example*:  \n> “Upon return or destruction of Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall provide written certification to the Disclosing Party confirming compliance with this Section.”\n\n---\n\n### **9. Third-Party Disclosure Limitations**\n\n✅ **Compliant**: Section 3 allows disclosure only to employees/agents with a need-to-know who agree to comparable confidentiality obligations.\n\n⚠️ **Risk**: No express requirement that third-party obligations **mirror the 5-year survival term**.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:\n> Explicitly state that third parties must be bound by the same duration.\n>\n> *Example*:  \n> “Any third party receiving Confidential Information pursuant to this Section shall be bound by confidentiality obligations no less protective than those herein, including the five (5) year survival period.”\n\n---\n\n### **10. Remedies & Enforcement Post-Term**\n\n❌ **Non-Compliant**: No explicit statement that remedies (injunctive relief, damages) survive beyond the term — especially critical for trade secrets.\n\n⚠️ **Risk**: Could be interpreted that claims expire after 5 years, even if trade secret misappropriation occurs later.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:\n> Add a clause preserving remedies for breaches occurring during or after the term, particularly for trade secrets.\n>\n> *Example*:  \n> “The parties acknowledge that monetary damages may be inadequate remedy for breach of this Agreement. Nothing herein shall limit the Disclosing Party’s right to seek injunctive relief or other equitable remedies for any breach, whether occurring during or after the term of this Agreement, including with respect to trade secrets.”\n\n---\n\n### **11. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution Impact**\n\n✅ **Compliant**: Governing law is Massachusetts (favorable for enforcement), jurisdiction is exclusive to MA courts.\n\n⚠️ **Risk**: Arbitration not offered — may lead to costly litigation if disputes arise.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:\n> Consider adding optional arbitration clause for faster resolution.\n>\n> *Example*:  \n> “At the election of either party, any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules.”\n\n---\n\n### **12. Clarity of Language**\n\n✅ **Mostly Compliant**: Terms like “Receiving Party,” “Disclosing Party,” and “Confidential Information” are defined.\n\n⚠️ **Risk**: Phrases like “for the Purpose” are vague. “Purpose” is defined broadly — could allow expansive interpretation.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:\n> Define “Purpose” more narrowly and tie it to specific projects or activities.\n>\n> *Example*:  \n> “‘Purpose’ means evaluating potential collaboration on [specify project name or scope], including preliminary discussions regarding licensing or sponsored research, and shall not include any commercial development or publication outside the scope of such evaluation without prior written consent.”\n\nAlso, define “Confidential Period” explicitly in Definitions section.\n\n---\n\n# 📊 SUMMARY RISK MATRIX\n\n| Checkpoint | Status | Risk Level | Recommendation |\n|------------|--------|------------|----------------|\n| 1. Explicit Timeframe | ✅ | Medium | Tie survival to date of disclosure |\n| 2. Post-Term Survival | ✅ | Medium | Clarify termination upon public availability |\n| 3. Perpetual Clauses | ✅ | Low | Add disclaimer against implied perpetuity |\n| 4. Event-Based Triggers | ⚠️ | Medium | Define “publicly known” + notice mechanism |\n| 5. Trade Secrets Distinction | ❌ | High | Add indefinite protection for trade secrets |\n| 6. Jurisdictional Compliance | ✅ | Low | Add severability clause |\n| 7. Renewal Provisions | ❌ | Medium | Allow mutual extensions for new disclosures |\n| 8. Return/Destruction | ✅ | Low | Add certification requirement |\n| 9. Third-Party Obligations | ✅ | Medium | Mirror duration for third parties |\n| 10. Remedies Post-Term | ❌ | High | Preserve injunctive/damages rights post-term |\n| 11. Governing Law | ✅ | Low | Consider adding arbitration option |\n| 12. Clarity of Language | ✅ | Medium | Define “Purpose” and “Confidential Period” |\n\n---\n\n# 💡 STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HARVARD (RECIPIENT)\n\n1. **Negotiate Survival Based on Disclosure Date** – Not Effective Date – to avoid being locked into 5 years for info disclosed on Day 720.\n2. **Insist on Trade Secret Exception** – Ensure true trade secrets are protected indefinitely under law.\n3. **Require Certification of Destruction** – Minimize risk of undocumented retention.\n4. **Limit “Purpose” Scope** – Avoid open-ended use of confidential info.\n5. **Preserve Remedies Indefinitely for Trade Secrets** – Critical for legal enforceability.\n6. **Add Severability Clause** – Protects enforceability if parts are struck down.\n7. **Consider Optional Arbitration** – Faster, cheaper dispute resolution.\n\n---\n\n# ✍️ SAMPLE AMENDED LANGUAGE (Key Sections)\n\n#### ➤ Revise Section 8 (Termination; Return of Confidential Information):\n\n> “The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and expire on the date that is two (2) years later. Either party may terminate this Agreement sooner upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other party.  \n>   \n> **Survival of Obligations**: The Receiving Party’s non-disclosure and non-use obligations under this Agreement with respect to Confidential Information it has received hereunder shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement for a period of five (5) years from the date of disclosure of such Confidential Information, provided that such obligations shall terminate earlier if the information becomes publicly available through no fault of the Receiving Party.  \n>   \n> **Trade Secret Protection**: To the extent any Confidential Information qualifies as a trade secret under applicable law (including the Defend Trade Secrets Act or Uniform Trade Secrets Act), the Receiving Party’s obligations shall continue indefinitely so long as such information remains a trade secret, subject to the exceptions set forth in Section 2.  \n>   \n> **Return or Destruction**: Upon termination of this Agreement, or sooner upon the Disclosing Party’s written request, the Receiving Party shall promptly return to the Disclosing Party all of the Confidential Information it has received hereunder and return or destroy all copies, summaries, synopses and abstracts of such Confidential Information in its possession... The Receiving Party shall provide written certification to the Disclosing Party confirming completion of such return or destruction.”\n\n#### ➤ Add New Section (Optional):\n\n> **Section X. Remedies Survive Term**  \n> “Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the Disclosing Party’s right to seek injunctive relief, declaratory judgment, or damages for any breach of confidentiality obligations, whether occurring during or after the term of this Agreement, including with respect to trade secrets.”\n\n---\n\n# ✅ FINAL VERDICT\n\nWhile the current CDA provides a **functional framework**, it poses **moderate to high risk to Harvard** due to:\n- Overly broad survival period tied to Effective Date\n- Lack of distinction between general info and trade secrets\n- Absence of certification, precise definitions, and remedy preservation\n\nWith the suggested revisions, Harvard can maintain its academic freedom, comply with legal standards, and reduce exposure to unnecessary long-term liability — all while preserving legitimate business relationships.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you’d like this formatted into a **redlined version**, **checklist template**, or **negotiation script** for Harvard’s OTD team.",

No mention of refunds anywhere in the contract.\n\n❌ **Critical Risk**:  \n- If the event is canceled due to Force Majeure, **there is no obligation to refund** any portion of the $_________ sponsorship fee.\n- This creates **unacceptable financial risk** for the Sponsor — especially if the event is postponed indefinitely or canceled without recourse.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:  \n> Add new subsection under Section 15:  \n> **“Refund Obligations Upon Force Majeure Cancellation”**  \n> *If the Conference or Event is canceled in whole or in part due to a Force Majeure Event, Recipient shall refund to Sponsor (i) 100% of all funds paid if cancellation occurs more than 30 days prior to the scheduled start date; or (ii) a pro-rata amount based on the percentage of the event not delivered if cancellation occurs within 30 days of the event. Refunds shall be issued within 30 days of cancellation notice.*\n\n> Also consider adding:\n> *“In lieu of a refund, Sponsor may elect to receive credit toward a future event or equivalent virtual/digital activation, subject to mutual written agreement.”*\n\n---\n\n### ➤ CHECKPOINT 3: Refund Amount & Structure\n> **Current Status**: Not addressed.\n\n❌ **Risk**:  \n- No cap on non-refundable costs. Recipient could claim “production expenses” or “marketing sunk costs” as justification for withholding funds — even if no services were rendered.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:  \n> Insert language limiting deductions:  \n> *“Any refund shall not be reduced by costs incurred by Recipient unless such costs were pre-approved in writing by Sponsor and directly attributable to Sponsor-specific deliverables (e.g., branded signage, custom content). All such costs must be documented and submitted with invoice.”*\n\n---\n\n### ➤ CHECKPOINT 4: Timeline for Refund Issuance\n> **Current Status**: Not specified.\n\n❌ **Risk**:  \n- Delayed refunds can tie up capital and create cash flow issues for large sponsors.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:  \n> Add to Section 15:  \n> *“Recipient shall issue any refund owed under this Section within thirty (30) calendar days following written notification of cancellation or postponement exceeding six (6) months. Failure to remit payment within this period shall accrue interest at 1.5% per month.”*\n\n---\n\n### ➤ CHECKPOINT 5: Alternative Remedies Clause\n> **Current Status**: Not mentioned.\n\n❌ **Risk**:  \n- No flexibility offered to Sponsor — must accept refund or nothing.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:  \n> Add:  \n> *“Sponsor may, at its sole discretion, elect to apply the full or partial sponsorship amount as credit toward a future event, digital activation, or alternative marketing initiative mutually agreed upon in writing by both parties. Such credit shall expire twelve (12) months from issuance unless extended by mutual consent.”*\n\n---\n\n### ➤ CHECKPOINT 6: Notice Requirements & Burden of Proof\n> **Current Status**: Silent.\n\n❌ **Risk**:  \n- Recipient may invoke Force Majeure without proof, leaving Sponsor unable to verify legitimacy.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:  \n> Add:  \n> *“Recipient shall provide Sponsor with written notice of any Force Majeure Event within five (5) business days of occurrence, accompanied by supporting documentation (e.g., official government closure order, event organizer cancellation notice, insurance claim denial letter). Sponsor reserves the right to request additional verification.”*\n\n---\n\n### ➤ CHECKPOINT 7: Termination Rights Beyond Force Majeure\n> **Current Status**: Only termination for convenience is implied via Section 13 (assignment), but no express right to terminate early.\n\n❌ **Risk**:  \n- If event quality declines, misrepresentation occurs, or partner breaches obligations, Sponsor has **no unilateral exit right**.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:  \n> Add new Section:  \n> **“Termination for Material Breach or Convenience”**  \n> *Sponsor may terminate this Agreement for cause upon material breach by Recipient (including failure to deliver agreed benefits, violation of exclusivity if later added, or fraud) with 15 days’ written notice to cure. Sponsor may also terminate for convenience with 60 days’ notice, entitling it to a pro-rata refund of unused sponsorship fees based on undelivered benefits.*\n\n---\n\n## II. 🚫 EXCLUSIVITY & COMPETITOR RESTRICTIONS REVIEW\n\n### ➤ CHECKPOINT 8: Scope of “Direct Competitors”\n> **Current Clause (Section 9)**:  \n> *“Recipient shall have the right to contract with other corporate sponsors in competing industries and within the same sectors of competing industries…”*\n\n🚨 **Major Red Flag**:  \n- **Explicitly waives exclusivity** — meaning Pepsi, Unilever, or any direct competitor can sponsor the same event alongside J&J.\n- No definition of “competing industries” — leaves room for ambiguity and abuse.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:  \n> **Delete Section 9 entirely** and replace with:  \n> **“Exclusive Category Sponsorship”**  \n> *Sponsor shall be the exclusive sponsor in the [specify category, e.g., “Healthcare Products”, “Pharmaceuticals”, “Personal Care”] category for the duration of the Conference or Event. Recipient agrees not to accept sponsorship, co-branding, or promotional partnerships from any entity that competes directly with Sponsor in the same product line, geographic region, or target demographic as defined in Attachment A. A list of prohibited brands shall be attached as Exhibit C.*\n\n> Also add:  \n> *“For purposes of this Agreement, ‘direct competitor’ means any company that markets products or services substantially similar to those marketed by Sponsor in the same category, including but not limited to [list examples: Procter & Gamble, Bayer, Novartis, etc.].”*\n\n---\n\n### ➤ CHECKPOINT 9: Exclusivity Territory & Duration\n> **Current Status**: Not applicable — exclusivity is waived.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:  \n> Define scope:  \n> *“Exclusivity applies to all physical and digital activations related to the Conference or Event, including but not limited to signage, website banners, email blasts, social media posts, press releases, speaker introductions, booth placements, and merchandise. Exclusivity shall extend to all pre-event promotions (up to 60 days prior) and post-event recaps (up to 30 days after).”*\n\n---\n\n### ➤ CHECKPOINT 10: Sponsorship Tier & Category Exclusivity\n> **Current Status**: Vague — only says “exclusive sponsor of the event (if applicable)” — which contradicts Section 9.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:  \n> Clarify tier structure:  \n> *“Sponsor shall be designated as the ‘Title Sponsor’ or ‘Presenting Sponsor’ of the Conference or Event, granting it top-tier visibility and priority placement across all platforms. No other sponsor shall occupy the same tier or receive comparable recognition.”*\n\n> Add carve-out exception:  \n> *“Notwithstanding the foregoing, Recipient may designate one ‘Community Partner’ or ‘Non-Profit Ally’ provided such entity does not compete with Sponsor and receives no commercial promotion or branding rights.”*\n\n---\n\n### ➤ CHECKPOINT 11: Competitor Presence Monitoring & Enforcement\n> **Current Status**: No monitoring requirement.\n\n❌ **Risk**:  \n- Competitors may sneak in through third-party vendors, influencers, or satellite activations.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:  \n> Add:  \n> *“Recipient shall actively monitor and prevent the presence or promotion of any direct competitor during the Conference or Event. Recipient shall notify Sponsor immediately upon discovery of any unauthorized competitor activity and take corrective action within 48 hours. Failure to do so shall constitute material breach.”*\n\n---\n\n### ➤ CHECKPOINT 12: Subcontractors & Third-Party Partners\n> **Current Status**: Silent.\n\n❌ **Risk**:  \n- Influencers or media partners might promote competitors despite contractual exclusivity.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:  \n> Add:  \n> *“All subcontractors, vendors, influencers, and third-party partners engaged by Recipient in connection with the Conference or Event shall be bound by the same exclusivity provisions herein. Sponsor shall have the right to review and approve all such third-party agreements before execution.”*\n\n---\n\n### ➤ CHECKPOINT 13: Right to Audit or Inspect\n> **Current Status**: Not included.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:  \n> Add:  \n> *“Sponsor shall have the right, upon reasonable notice, to inspect all promotional materials, digital assets, signage, and活动现场 (on-site) branding to ensure compliance with exclusivity and trademark usage requirements. Any non-compliance discovered shall be corrected within five (5) business days.”*\n\n---\n\n### ➤ CHECKPOINT 14: Remedies for Breach of Exclusivity\n> **Current Status**: None.\n\n❌ **Risk**:  \n- No penalty, compensation, or termination right if exclusivity is violated.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:  \n> Add:  \n> *“In the event of a breach of exclusivity, Sponsor shall be entitled to one or more of the following remedies, at its sole election: (a) immediate termination of this Agreement; (b) pro-rata refund of sponsorship fees; (c) bonus exposure equal to 150% of original benefit package; or (d) liquidated damages equal to 200% of the sponsorship fee, payable within 30 days.”*\n\n> *(Note: Liquidated damages should reflect actual harm — e.g., loss of market share, dilution of brand equity — and be enforceable under state law.)*\n\n---\n\n### ➤ CHECKPOINT 15: Survival Clause\n> **Current Status**: Only Sections 4–18 survive termination — but exclusivity is already waived.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:  \n> If exclusivity is reinstated, add:  \n> *“The exclusivity obligations set forth in Section X shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter, preventing Recipient from promoting any direct competitor in association with the Conference or Event name, branding, or intellectual property.”*\n\n---\n\n## III. ✅ GENERAL SAFEGUARDS TO INCLUDE\n\n### ➤ CHECKPOINT 16: Governing Law & Dispute Resolution\n> **Current Clause (Section 16)**: Arbitration in New Jersey under AAA rules.\n\n✅ **Strength**: Neutral forum, avoids litigation delays.\n\n⚠️ **Consideration**: Ensure arbitration clause allows for expedited proceedings and caps attorney fees.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:  \n> Add:  \n> *“Arbitration shall be conducted on an expedited basis with a hearing scheduled within 60 days of filing. Each party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees unless the arbitrator finds one party acted in bad faith, in which case the prevailing party shall recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.”*\n\n---\n\n### ➤ CHECKPOINT 17: Entire Agreement & Amendment Clauses\n> **Current Clause (Section 19)**: Good — requires written amendments.\n\n✅ **Strength**: Prevents oral modifications.\n\n📌 **Recommendation**: Keep as-is.\n\n---\n\n### ➤ CHECKPOINT 18: Assignment & Transfer Restrictions\n> **Current Clause (Section 13)**: Strong — requires prior written consent.\n\n✅ **Strength**: Protects against unwanted assignment to unknown entities.\n\n📌 **Recommendation**: Keep as-is.\n\n---\n\n## IV. 📋 ADDITIONAL CRITICAL GAPS TO ADDRESS\n\n### ➤ Missing Benefit Schedule (Section 2a)\n> Currently blank:  \n> *“Sponsor shall receive the following benefits: _______________________________________________________”*\n\n❌ **Risk**: No legal recourse if promised benefits aren’t delivered.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:  \n> Attach **Attachment A – Detailed Sponsor Benefits Package**, including:\n> - Logo placement (size, location, duration)\n> - Speaking opportunities\n> - Booth space dimensions\n> - Number of VIP tickets\n> - Social media shoutouts (minimum #, platforms, timing)\n> - Email blast inclusion\n> - Press release mentions\n> - Post-event reporting metrics (attendance, impressions, engagement)\n\n> Include:  \n> *“Failure to deliver any benefit listed in Attachment A shall entitle Sponsor to a proportional reduction in sponsorship fee or replacement benefit of equal or greater value, as determined by Sponsor.”*\n\n---\n\n### ➤ One-Sided Trademark Approval Process\n> Current Clause (Section 3):  \n> - Sponsor approves all use of its Marks → good.  \n> - But Recipient controls approval of its own Marks → problematic.\n\n❌ **Risk**: Recipient may misuse Sponsor’s Marks in ways that damage reputation.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:  \n> Add reciprocity:  \n> *“Sponsor shall have the right to approve all materials incorporating Sponsor Marks, including but not limited to digital ads, printed collateral, video content, and social media posts. Recipient shall submit drafts for approval at least ten (10) business days prior to publication. Failure to obtain approval shall constitute material breach.”*\n\n---\n\n### ➤ No Performance Metrics or Reporting Requirements\n> Nothing requires Recipient to report on ROI, attendance, reach, or impact.\n\n📌 **Improvement Suggestion**:  \n> Add:  \n> *“Recipient shall provide Sponsor with a comprehensive post-event report within 30 days of conclusion, including: total attendance, digital impressions, social media analytics, survey feedback, photos/videos of branding execution, and comparison against baseline KPIs outlined in Attachment A.”*\n\n---\n\n## ✍️ FINAL RECOMMENDATION SUMMARY\n\n| Area | Issue | Recommended Action |\n|------|-------|---------------------|\n| **Force Majeure** | No refund guarantee | Add explicit refund triggers, timelines, alternatives, burden of proof |\n| **Exclusivity** | Explicitly waived | Delete Section 9; insert strong exclusivity clause with definitions, monitoring, penalties |\n| **Benefits Delivery** | Blank section | Attach detailed benefit schedule with measurable KPIs and remedies for non-delivery |\n| **Trademark Use** | One-sided approval | Require mutual approval process for all branding materials |\n| **Remedies** | None for breach | Add liquidated damages, termination rights, bonus exposure options |\n| **Audit Rights** | Absent | Grant Sponsor right to inspect materials and活动现场 |\n| **Third Parties** | Unregulated | Bind all subcontractors/influencers to exclusivity terms |\n| **Survival** | Exclusivity doesn't survive | Extend exclusivity obligations post-event if applicable |\n\n---\n\n## 🧾 NEXT STEPS FOR SPONSOR (J&J FOUNDATION)\n\n1. **Redline the Contract** using the above suggestions.\n2. **Attach Exhibits A–C**:\n   - **Exhibit A**: Sponsor Marks + Usage Guidelines\n   - **Exhibit B**: Recipient Marks\n   - **Exhibit C**: List of Direct Competitors + Defined Categories\n   - **Attachment A**: Detailed Sponsor Benefits + KPIs\n3. **Negotiate Hard on Exclusivity and Refunds** — these are deal-breakers for brand integrity and ROI.\n4. **Require Legal Counsel Review** before signing — especially regarding enforceability of liquidated damages and arbitration clauses.\n5. **Document All Verbal Agreements** — ensure everything is captured in writing per Section 19.\n\n---\n\n## 💡 BONUS: SAMPLE REDLINE LANGUAGE FOR KEY CLAUSES\n\n### Replace Section 9 With:\n> **“Exclusive Sponsorship Rights”**  \n> *Sponsor shall be the exclusive sponsor in the [insert category] category for the Conference or Event. Recipient shall not accept sponsorship, co-branding, or promotional partnerships from any entity that competes directly with Sponsor in the same product line, geographic region, or target demographic. For purposes of this Agreement, ‘direct competitor’ means any company that markets products or services substantially similar to those marketed by Sponsor in the same category, including but not limited to [list examples: Procter & Gamble, Bayer, Novartis, etc.]. A complete list of prohibited brands shall be attached as Exhibit C. Violation of this provision shall constitute material breach and entitle Sponsor to remedies including termination, refund, bonus exposure, or liquidated damages as set forth in Section [X].*\n\n---\n\n### Add New Section After Section 15:\n> **“Refund Obligations Upon Force Majeure Cancellation”**  \n> *If the Conference or Event is canceled in whole or in part due to a Force Majeure Event, Recipient shall refund to Sponsor (i) 100% of all funds paid if cancellation occurs more than 30 days prior to the scheduled start date; or (ii) a pro-rata amount based on the percentage of the event not delivered if cancellation occurs within 30 days of the event. Refunds shall be issued within 30 days of cancellation notice. In lieu of a refund, Sponsor may elect to receive credit toward a future event or equivalent digital activation, subject to mutual written agreement.*\n\n---\n\n## 🏁 CONCLUSION\n\nThis contract, in its current form, **does not protect the interests of a major brand sponsor like Johnson & Johnson**. It lacks enforceable exclusivity, clear refund policies, performance guarantees, and accountability mechanisms.\n\nWith targeted revisions — particularly around **exclusivity enforcement**, **refund triggers**, **benefit specificity**, and **remedies for breach** — this can become a powerful, risk-managed sponsorship vehicle that delivers true brand value and protects investment.\n\nLet me know if you’d like:\n- A fully redlined version of the contract\n- Editable Word/PDF template\n- Negotiation talking points for internal stakeholders\n- Draft Exhibits A–C\n\nYou’re positioned to negotiate strongly — don’t let this opportunity slip away without securing what your brand deserves.\n\n--- \n\n✅ **Final Note**: As a global healthcare leader, J&J must safeguard its brand equity, ensure ethical alignment, and maximize ROI. These changes are not just legal protections — they’re strategic imperatives."

The Start node collects inputs, followed by three LLM nodes for title, body, and introduction generation, a Template node for content integration, and an End node for final output. This matches the design_principle description.\nb. Exact Node Set Matching: The workflow JSON contains nodes of types 'start', 'llm', 'template-transform', and 'end'. The node_selection list includes 'Start', 'LLM', 'LLM', 'LLM', 'Template', 'End'. The node types in the workflow JSON exactly match the node_selection list, considering that 'LLM' and 'llm' are the same node type, and 'Template' and 'template-transform' are the same node type. Therefore, Rule 2 is satisfied.\n",

This is the most efficient approach for analyzing images to identify incorrect answers (e.g., looking for red crosses) and extracting detailed context.\n3.  **Prompt Engineering**: The LLM is prompted with specific instructions to identify incorrect questions, classify them by type, determine difficulty, and extract the required fields (`question_text`, `subject`, `question_type`, `difficulty`, `answer`, `user_answer`, `explanation`). Crucially, the LLM is instructed to output the result strictly as a raw JSON string without markdown formatting to ensure the output is ready for use.\n4.  **Output**: The \"End\" node captures the text output from the LLM (which is the JSON string) and assigns it to the variable `result` as requested.",

The \"Start\" and \"Document Extractor\" nodes handle input and extraction. The \"LLM\" nodes generate questions with answers, the \"Template\" node assembles the teacher's version, and another \"LLM\" node creates the student's version. The \"End\" node outputs both versions. The workflow does not violate the design_principle.\nb. Exact Node Set Matching: The node types extracted from the workflow JSON are ['start', 'document-extractor', 'llm', 'llm', 'llm', 'llm', 'template-transform', 'llm', 'end'].

The word **“manipulation”** is a noun derived from the verb *manipulate*, and it carries multiple meanings depending on context — ranging from physical handling to psychological influence. Below is a detailed analysis:\n\n---\n\n## 🔹 **Definitions of “Manipulation”**\n\n### 1. **The act of handling or controlling something physically**\n> *Often refers to skilled or careful use of the hands, especially in medical, mechanical, or artistic contexts.*\n\n**Example:**\n> “The surgeon’s manipulation of the surgical instruments was precise and steady.”\n\n---\n\n### 2. **The act of managing or influencing people or situations cleverly or unscrupulously**\n> *This is the most common modern usage — often with negative connotations, implying deceit or exploitation.*\n\n**Example:**\n> “Her emotional manipulation made her friends feel guilty into doing what she wanted.”\n\n---\n\n### 3. **In psychology or sociology: the deliberate influence over behavior or thought**\n> *Can be neutral or negative, depending on intent — e.g., advertising, propaganda, or therapy techniques.*\n\n**Example:**\n> “The advertisement used subtle manipulation to make consumers associate the product with happiness.”\n\n---\n\n### 4. **In finance or economics: artificial control of markets or prices**\n> *Usually illegal or unethical — such as stock market manipulation.*\n\n**Example:**\n> “Regulators are investigating allegations of price manipulation by several hedge funds.”\n\n---\n\n### 5. **In computing or data science: the processing or transformation of data**\n> *Neutral technical term — refers to modifying or organizing data for analysis.*\n\n**Example:**\n> “Data manipulation is a crucial step before running statistical models.”\n\n---\n\n## 🔹 **Synonyms (by context)**\n\n- Physical handling → *handling, adjustment, operation*\n- Psychological influence → *control, coercion, deception, persuasion (if ethical)*\n- Financial → *rigging, tampering, collusion*\n- Technical → *processing, transformation, modification*\n\n---\n\n## 🔹 **Antonyms**\n\n- Honesty, transparency, integrity (for deceptive manipulation)\n- Inaction, passivity (for active control)\n- Natural occurrence (vs. artificial manipulation)\n\n---\n\n## 🔹 **Example Sentences in Context**\n\n1. **Medical context:**\n> “The physical therapist used gentle manipulation to relieve the patient’s back pain.”\n\n2. **Psychological/interpersonal context:**\n> “He realized too late that his partner had been manipulating him for years to get what she wanted.”\n\n3. **Political context:**\n> “The election results were called into question due to widespread voter manipulation.”\n\n4. **Technical/data context:**\n> “Before visualizing the dataset, we performed extensive manipulation to clean and normalize the values.”\n\n5. **Financial context:**\n> “The company was fined for market manipulation after artificially inflating its stock price.”\n\n---\n\n## 🔹 **Etymology**\n\nFrom Latin *manipulare* (“to handle”), from *manus* (“hand”) + *pilum* (“a small tool or weapon”). Originally referred to handling objects or troops (as in Roman military formations), later extended metaphorically to handling people or situations.\n\n---\n\n## 🔹 **Note on Connotation**\n\nWhile “manipulation” can be neutral in technical fields (e.g., data manipulation), in social or interpersonal contexts, it almost always carries a **negative tone**, implying **lack of ethics, honesty, or consent**.\n\n---\n\n✅ **Summary**:  \n*Manipulation* = the act of controlling, handling, or influencing — either skillfully (neutral/positive) or deceptively (negative).

    "llm_output_test1": "result: Certainly! Here's a detailed analysis of the English word **“humorous”**:\n\n---\n\n### **Word:** humorous  \n**Part of Speech:** Adjective  \n**Pronunciation:** /ˈhjuːmərəs/ (HYOO-muh-rus)  \n**Etymology:** From Latin *humor* (“moisture, bodily fluid”) → Middle French *humoreux* → English “humorous,” originally referring to the balance of bodily humors; later evolved to mean “inclined to laughter or jest.”\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Definitions:\n\n1. **Causing laughter or amusement; funny.**  \n   → Used to describe something that is intended to be entertaining or comical.  \n   *Example: The comedian’s humorous monologue had the audience in stitches.*\n\n2. **Having or showing a sense of humor; witty or playful.**  \n   → Describes a person who enjoys or excels at making others laugh.  \n   *Example: She’s known for her humorous remarks during meetings — she always lightens the mood.*\n\n3. *(Less common, archaic)* **Relating to or influenced by humor (in the old medical sense of bodily fluids).**  \n   → Rarely used today; mostly historical.\n\n---\n\n## 📚 Example Sentences:\n\n1. **As an adjective describing content or style:**  \n   > The book is filled with humorous anecdotes about life in the 1980s.  \n   > His humorous take on everyday frustrations made the podcast a hit.\n\n2. **Describing a person’s personality or behavior:**  \n   > Even in stressful situations, he remains surprisingly humorous and calm.  \n   > My uncle is a humorous storyteller — every family gathering features his exaggerated tales.\n\n3. **Used in contrast or to highlight tone:**  \n   > Though the topic was serious, the speaker added a humorous twist to keep the audience engaged.  \n   > Her humorous reply masked her true frustration — only close friends noticed.\n\n4. **In writing or media reviews:**  \n   > Critics praised the film’s humorous dialogue and clever visual gags.  \n   > The article’s humorous tone made complex economic concepts easy to digest.\n\n---\n\n## 🔁 Synonyms:\n- Funny  \n- Witty  \n- Comedic  \n- Amusing  \n- Playful  \n- Lighthearted\n\n## ❌ Antonyms:\n- Serious  \n- Solemn  \n- Dull  \n- Gloomy  \n- Humorless\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Notes:\n\n- “Humorous” is often confused with “humourous” — but “humourous” is not standard in American English (though it may appear in British English due to the spelling “humour”). In both dialects, **“humorous”** is the correct and widely accepted form.\n- It can also be used ironically: *His humorous suggestion to solve world hunger was clearly not meant to be taken seriously.*\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you’d like to explore its noun form (*humor/humour*) or related phrases!",

    "llm_output_test2": "result: 这首诗是唐代大诗人**李白**的名篇《**将进酒**》，属于乐府旧题，原为汉代乐府古辞，内容多咏饮酒放歌。李白此作虽沿用旧题，却注入了强烈的个人情感与时代精神，成为盛唐豪放诗风的巅峰之作。\n\n---\n\n## 🌊 一、全诗译文（意译）：\n\n你难道没有看见——  \n黄河之水从天而降，奔腾入海，一去不返！  \n你难道没有看见——  \n高堂明镜中，白发悄然滋生，清晨还是青丝如墨，黄昏已成雪鬓霜颜！\n\n人生得意时，就该尽情欢乐，  \n别让金杯空对明月，虚度良宵！  \n上天赋予我才华，必有其用；  \n千金散尽，还会再来！\n\n杀羊宰牛，且图一醉，  \n今日聚会，定要饮它三百杯！\n\n岑夫子啊，丹丘生，  \n快把酒杯斟满，莫停杯！  \n我为你们唱一支歌，  \n请你们侧耳倾听！\n\n钟鼓美馔、玉食珍馐，都不足贵重，  \n我只愿长醉不愿清醒！  \n自古圣贤皆寂寞无闻，  \n唯有豪饮者，才留名千古！\n\n当年陈王曹植宴饮平乐观，  \n斗酒十千，纵情欢谑，何等豪迈！  \n主人何必说钱少？  \n尽管去买酒来，与君共酌！\n\n五花马、千金裘，  \n叫孩子拿去换美酒吧！  \n让我们一起，消解这万古愁思！\n\n---\n\n## 🎭 二、诗歌主旨与情感：\n\n本诗以“劝酒”为表，实则抒写**人生苦短、及时行乐、怀才不遇、愤世嫉俗**的复杂情绪。李白借酒浇愁，表面狂放不羁，内里却是深沉悲慨。\n\n- **“黄河之水天上来”** —— 以壮阔自然起兴，暗喻时间无情、生命短暂。\n- **“朝如青丝暮成雪”** —— 极言人生易老，感慨光阴飞逝。\n- **“天生我材必有用”** —— 自信豪迈，是李白自我价值的宣言。\n- **“钟鼓馔玉不足贵，但愿长醉不愿醒”** —— 对功名富贵的蔑视，对现实的逃避。\n- **“古来圣贤皆寂寞”** —— 抒发怀才不遇、知音难觅的孤寂。\n- **“与尔同销万古愁”** —— 全诗收束于“愁”，这是贯穿始终的情感核心。\n\n整首诗情感跌宕起伏，语言奔放豪迈，节奏铿锵有力，极具感染力，被誉为“酒中仙”的李白，在此诗中淋漓尽致地展现了他浪漫主义的天才气质。\n\n---\n\n## 📜 三、创作背景：\n\n《将进酒》大约创作于**天宝十一载（752年）左右**，此时李白已被唐玄宗“赐金放还”，离开长安已有数年。他游历梁宋（今河南开封、商丘一带），与友人岑勋（岑夫子）、元丹丘（丹丘生）相聚饮酒，借酒抒怀。\n\n- 李白曾怀抱“济苍生、安社稷”的政治理想，但仕途坎坷，被排挤出朝廷；\n- 此时虽表面洒脱，实则内心苦闷，借酒消愁；\n- 诗中“圣贤寂寞”、“陈王欢谑”等句，既是对历史人物的追慕，也是对自身遭遇的影射；\n- “五花马，千金裘，呼儿换美酒”——看似豪奢，实为倾尽所有，表达“宁可散尽家财，也要一醉解愁”的决绝。\n\n---\n\n## ✨ 四、艺术特色：\n\n1. **夸张手法**：如“黄河之水天上来”、“会须一饮三百杯”，极尽夸张，气势磅礴。\n2. **对比强烈**：青春与衰老、富贵与贫贱、圣贤与饮者，形成强烈反差。\n3. **句式自由**：长短错落，韵律随情感起伏，打破格律束缚，体现盛唐气象。\n4. **情感真挚**：悲喜交织，豪放中见悲凉，狂歌中藏无奈，极具人性深度。\n\n---\n\n## 🏆 五、历史评价：\n\n- 清代沈德潜评：“太白纵笔如飞，一气呵成，有天马行空不可羁勒之势。”\n- 现代学者余光中赞：“李白是酒中仙，更是诗中神。”\n- 此诗被视为中国古典诗歌中“豪放派”的代表作，影响深远，至今仍广为传诵。\n\n---\n\n## 💡 总结：\n\n《将进酒》不仅是李白个人命运的悲歌，更是盛唐士人理想幻灭后的集体呐喊。它用最豪迈的语言，诉说最深沉的忧愁；用最狂放的姿态，掩盖最脆弱的灵魂。在酒杯与诗句之间，我们看到一个天才诗人对生命、时间、命运的深刻思考与不屈抗争。\n\n> **“人生得意须尽欢，莫使金樽空对月。”**  \n> —— 这不是颓废，而是对生命有限性的清醒认知；  \n> **“天生我材必有用，千金散尽还复来。”**  \n> —— 这不是自负，而是对自我价值的坚定信念。\n\n---\n\n如果你喜欢这类作品，还可以阅读李白的《月下独酌》《行路难》《梦游天姥吟留别》等，都是他“诗仙”气质的集中体现。",

    "llm_output_test3": "result: 这首诗是唐代大诗人**李白**的名篇《**梦游天姥吟留别**》。全诗以梦境为线索，描绘了一幅瑰丽奇幻、气势磅礴的神仙世界图景，最终回归现实，表达诗人对自由人格的追求和对权贵的蔑视。此诗既是浪漫主义诗歌的巅峰之作，也饱含李白个人政治失意后的愤懑与超脱。\n\n---\n\n## 一、逐句释义与诗意解析\n\n### 第一段：引子 —— 由“瀛洲”到“天姥”\n\n> **海客谈瀛洲，烟涛微茫信难求；  \n> 越人语天姥，云霞明灭或可睹。**\n\n- “海客”指航海者，“瀛洲”是传说中的海上仙山，虚无缥缈，难以寻觅。\n- “越人”指浙江一带的人，“天姥山”在今浙江新昌，虽非仙山，但因传说中有仙迹，故“云霞明灭”时或可见其神异。\n- **寓意**：以“瀛洲”之不可求，反衬“天姥”之尚可梦中一见，为下文“梦游”埋下伏笔。\n\n> **天姥连天向天横，势拔五岳掩赤城。  \n> 天台四万八千丈，对此欲倒东南倾。**\n\n- 夸张手法极写天姥山之高峻雄伟：直插云霄，超越五岳（泰山、华山等），压过赤城山；连高达四万八千丈的天台山，在它面前都仿佛要倾倒。\n- **艺术效果**：用极度夸张渲染天姥山的神秘与崇高，为梦境铺垫壮阔背景。\n\n---\n\n### 第二段：入梦 —— 梦游仙境\n\n> **我欲因之梦吴越，一夜飞度镜湖月。  \n> 湖月照我影，送我至剡溪。**\n\n- 诗人受越人话语启发，决定“梦游”吴越之地（今浙江一带）。\n- “飞度镜湖月”极富动感与诗意，月光如舟，载他飞渡，意境空灵飘逸。\n\n> **谢公宿处今尚在，渌水荡漾清猿啼。  \n> 脚著谢公屐，身登青云梯。**\n\n- “谢公”指东晋山水诗人谢灵运，他曾游历剡溪，留下足迹。\n- 诗人穿上谢公特制的“木屐”，攀登如“青云梯”的山路，象征追随前贤、亲近自然。\n\n> **半壁见海日，空中闻天鸡。  \n> 千岩万转路不定，迷花倚石忽已暝。**\n\n- 登高望远，半山腰看日出东海，空中传来神话中的“天鸡”鸣叫。\n- 山路曲折，花影迷离，不知不觉天色已晚——暗示梦境渐入奇幻之境。\n\n> **熊咆龙吟殷岩泉，栗深林兮惊层巅。  \n> 云青青兮欲雨，水澹澹兮生烟。**\n\n- 熊吼龙吟，山谷震动；浓云欲雨，水面生烟——营造阴森诡谲、天地动荡的氛围。\n- “栗深林兮惊层巅”化用《楚辞·九歌》，增强神秘感与压迫感。\n\n> **列缺霹雳，丘峦崩摧。  \n> 洞天石扉，訇然中开。**\n\n- 电闪雷鸣，山崩地裂！洞天福地的石门轰然开启——这是进入仙境的关键转折！\n\n> **青冥浩荡不见底，日月照耀金银台。  \n> 霓为衣兮风为马，云之君兮纷纷而来下。  \n> 虎鼓瑟兮鸾回车，仙之人兮列如麻。**\n\n- 仙境展现：苍穹浩渺，日月辉映金银楼台。\n- 仙人着霓裳、乘风云，虎奏乐、鸾驾车，仙班济济——极尽想象之能事，描绘理想中的自由逍遥之境。\n\n> **忽魂悸以魄动，恍惊起而长嗟。  \n> 惟觉时之枕席，失向来之烟霞。**\n\n- 梦中震撼惊醒，方知一切皆幻。\n- “枕席”与“烟霞”对比强烈，梦醒后失落感油然而生。\n\n---\n\n### 第三段：梦醒 —— 抒发感慨与人生抉择\n\n> **世间行乐亦如此，古来万事东流水。**\n\n- 人生欢愉如梦境般短暂易逝，古今万事如东流之水，一去不返。\n- **哲理升华**：点出“人生如梦”的主题，带有佛道思想色彩。\n\n> **别君去兮何时还？且放白鹿青崖间，须行即骑访名山。**\n\n- 向友人告别：“我将离去，不知何时归来。”\n- “放白鹿于青崖”是隐逸生活的象征，呼应道教文化中“骑鹿访仙”的意象。\n- 表达归隐山林、纵情自然的愿望。\n\n> **安能摧眉折腰事权贵，使我不得开心颜？**\n\n- 全诗最震撼人心的一句！\n- “摧眉折腰”指卑躬屈膝侍奉权贵。\n- 李白宁可放弃仕途富贵，也要保持人格尊严与精神自由。\n- **核心精神**：不媚权贵、追求个性解放、崇尚自然与理想的浪漫主义宣言！\n\n---\n\n## 二、创作背景\n\n这首诗作于**唐玄宗天宝四年（公元745年）左右**，是李白被“赐金放还”离开长安之后所作。\n\n### 历史背景：\n\n- 李白早年怀有“济苍生、安社稷”的政治理想，曾被唐玄宗召入翰林院，一度春风得意。\n- 但因性格傲岸、不拘礼法，遭权贵排挤，最终被“赐金放还”，实际是被迫离开朝廷。\n- 此后他漫游山东、江南等地，寄情山水，借诗抒怀。\n\n### 创作动机：\n\n- 此诗题为《梦游天姥吟留别》，是李白即将离开东鲁（今山东）南游吴越时，写给当地友人的赠别诗。\n- 诗中“梦游”实为心灵之旅，借仙境寄托对现实政治的失望与对精神自由的向往。\n- 最后一句“安能摧眉折腰事权贵”正是他对宫廷生活的彻底决裂宣言。\n\n---\n\n## 三、艺术特色与文学地位\n\n1. **浪漫主义巅峰之作**：\n   - 想象奇崛，意境恢弘，语言奔放，充满神话色彩与超现实元素。\n   - 继承楚辞传统，融合道教神仙思想，开创盛唐浪漫主义诗风。\n\n2. **结构跌宕起伏**：\n   - 从现实引入梦境，再由梦境回归现实，层层递进，情感波澜壮阔。\n   - 结尾陡转，从奇幻归于清醒，强化了“人生如梦”的哲思。\n\n3. **象征与隐喻丰富**：\n   - “天姥山”象征理想境界；\n   - “仙人”代表精神自由；\n   - “权贵”象征现实束缚；\n   - “白鹿”“青崖”象征隐逸生活。\n\n4. **语言风格豪放洒脱**：\n   - 句式长短错落，节奏自由奔放，极具音乐性与画面感。\n   - 如“列缺霹雳，丘峦崩摧”、“霓为衣兮风为马”等句，音韵铿锵，气势磅礴。\n\n---\n\n## 四、总结：诗人的精神世界\n\n《梦游天姥吟留别》不仅是李白个人命运的写照，更是盛唐知识分子在理想与现实冲突中寻求出路的心灵史诗。\n\n> **他梦的是仙境，写的却是人间；  \n> 他逃的是官场，追的是自由；  \n> 他醉的是山水，醒的是骨气。**\n\n这首诗以其瑰丽的想象、深沉的情感和不朽的精神力量，成为中国古典诗歌中最富魅力的作品之一，至今仍激励着无数追求独立人格与精神自由的人们。\n\n---\n\n✅ **一句话概括全诗主旨**：  \n> **以梦游仙境喻人生理想，借醒后慨叹抒胸中块垒，终以“不事权贵”明志，彰显李白傲岸不羁、追求自由的人格光辉。**\n\n--- \n\n如需进一步赏析某段或分析与其他作品的比较，欢迎继续提问！"

A *clean* background should be solid black or transparent; here it’s visually cluttered.\n4. **Redundant/Unused Gradients**: `#a`, `#b`, `#c` are defined but not meaningfully used; `#b` and `#c` are identical and applied to the same shape — likely accidental.\n5. **Missing Serif Typography**: No text element for \"AURUM\" in a classic serif font (e.g., Didot, Bodoni, Playfair Display).\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Corrected & Complete SVG (Elegant Serif Text Logo – Black & Gold)\n\nHere is a refined, production-ready SVG meeting all requirements:\n- Solid black background (`#000`)\n- \"AURUM\" in elegant serif font (simulated via `font-family=\"Playfair Display\"`; fallbacks included)\n- Gold (`#D4AF37`) lettering with subtle inner shadow for depth\n- Clean, centered composition\n- Valid, self-contained SVG\n\n```xml\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" viewBox=\"0 0 1024 1024\">\n  <!-- Solid black background -->\n  <rect width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" fill=\"#000\"/>\n\n  <!-- AURUM text: elegant serif, gold with subtle inner glow -->\n  <text x=\"512\" y=\"540\" \n        text-anchor=\"middle\"\n        font-family=\"Playfair Display, Georgia, serif\"\n        font-size=\"144\"\n        font-weight=\"700\"\n        fill=\"#D4AF37\"\n        letter-spacing=\"8\">\n    AURUM\n  </text>\n\n  <!-- Optional: subtle inner shadow for premium depth (gold on black) -->\n  <filter id=\"innerGlow\" x=\"-50%\" y=\"-50%\" width=\"200%\" height=\"200%\">\n    <feGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\"2\" result=\"blur\"/>\n    <feComposite in=\"SourceGraphic\" in2=\"blur\" operator=\"over\" result=\"glow\"/>\n  </filter>\n  <text x=\"512\" y=\"540\" \n        text-anchor=\"middle\"\n        font-family=\"Playfair Display, Georgia, serif\"\n        font-size=\"144\"\n        font-weight=\"700\"\n        fill=\"#D4AF37\"\n        letter-spacing=\"8\"\n        filter=\"url(#innerGlow)\">\n    AURUM\n  </text>\n</svg>\n```\n\n> 🔹 **Why this works**:\n> - Uses `Playfair Display` (classic high-end serif) — widely available via Google Fonts; fallback to `Georgia`/`serif`.\n> - Gold (`#D4AF37`) on black evokes luxury (like 24k gold on obsidian).\n> - Centered, minimal, clean — no distracting elements.\n> - Includes subtle inner glow filter for tactile premium feel (optional; can be removed if pure flat design preferred).\n> - Fully valid, scalable, and ready for print/web.\n\nLet me know if you'd prefer an *abstract symbol* version (e.g., crown + diamond monogram) instead of text — I can generate that too."

Two classes are defined: \"Generate Minutes\" (original task) and \"Generate Speech\" (new task).\n3.  **Branch 1 (Minutes)**: This branch retains the original logic.

One aggregator handles the text content (result), and the other handles the generated files (file).

We know your time is valuable, and we’re committed to making every minute count. Today marks the official kickoff of our most exciting project yet: **designing a remote control that doesn’t just work — it delights, surprises, and redefines what users expect from a simple device.**\n\n## Our Mission: Original. Trendy. User-Friendly.\n\nLet’s be clear — this isn’t about incremental improvements. This is about *disruption*. We’re not building another box with buttons. We’re crafting an experience — one that stands out in a crowded market, wins hearts, and turns casual users into loyal advocates.\n\nTo do that, we must be:\n- **Original** — think beyond the expected.\n- **Trendy** — align with modern aesthetics and behaviors.\n- **User-Friendly** — intuitive, accessible, and joyful to use.\n\nAnd yes — we’re aiming high. Financially, we’re targeting a production cost under €12.50 and a retail price double that, driving toward a €50 million profit goal. But let’s not lose sight of the *why*: because when we get this right, we won’t just sell a product — we’ll set a new standard.\n\n---\n\n## The Design Journey: Three Pillars of Creation\n\nOur process will unfold in three critical phases:\n\n### 1. Functional Design  \n*What does the user need? What must this device DO?*  \nWe’ll map core functionalities — single vs. multi-device control, durability, waterproofing, even voice or whistle-based tracking. Every feature must serve a real human need.\n\n### 2. Conceptual Design  \n*How will it feel? How will it look? What trends will it ride?*  \nThis is where creativity meets strategy. Fewer buttons? Curved ergonomics? Ambient lighting? We’ll explore bold ideas — like a remote you can use in the bath — because innovation thrives at the edge of the absurd.\n\n### 3. Desired Design  \n*How will we bring it to life?*  \nHere, we refine, detail, and polish. From material choices to tactile feedback, every pixel and curve will be intentional.\n\n---\n\n## Let’s Get Creative — Even If It’s Silly\n\nRemember that drawing exercise? The orangutan. The cat named “Caramel.” The cow-donkey hybrid. Yes — it was playful. And that’s the point.\n\nCreativity doesn’t always come dressed in suits. Sometimes, it arrives as a scribble on a whiteboard — abstract, imperfect, but full of potential. Those drawings weren’t distractions; they were sparks. They reminded us that design begins with imagination — and imagination has no rules.\n\nSo let’s keep that spirit alive. Don’t censor your wild ideas. The best breakthroughs often start as jokes.\n\n---\n\n## Your Assignments: Own Your Domain\n\nAs we move forward, each of you will own a critical piece of this puzzle:\n\n🔹 **Industrial Designer**: Dive deep into feasibility. Can we make a waterproof remote? A whistle-responsive one? Explore materials, durability, and form. Bring us prototypes — even if they’re made of cardboard and dreams.\n\n🔹 **User Interface Designer**: Champion the user. Fewer buttons? Better grip? Backlit controls? Think ergonomics, accessibility, and delight. Make every interaction effortless — even in the dark.\n\n🔹 **Marketing Expert**: Define the non-negotiables. What MUST this remote do to win over customers? Bundle it? Sell it standalone? Identify the pain points — lost remotes, broken buttons, clumsy designs — and turn them into selling points.\n\nYou’ll receive follow-up emails with resources, deadlines, and inspiration. And yes — our next meeting is in 30 minutes. Don’t panic. Just prepare.\n\n---\n\n## Final Thought: Build Something That Matters\n\nThis isn’t just about hitting a profit target. It’s about creating something people *love*. Something that makes them smile when they pick it up. Something that feels less like a tool — and more like a companion.\n\nSo let’s challenge assumptions. Let’s embrace the weird.

Something that began as an idea, took shape through passion, and emerged as a symbol of what happens when brilliant minds come together with purpose.\n\nLet me begin by saying this: **we didn’t just build a product — we built a banana.**\n\nYes — a banana. Not metaphorically. Literally. A yellow, spongy, rubbery, wheel-equipped, delightfully absurd *banana-shaped* device that somehow manages to be both whimsical and brilliantly functional. And let me tell you — it’s not just cute. It’s *revolutionary*.\n\n---\n\n## The Heart of Our Success: Collaboration\n\nFrom the very first moment we held this prototype in our hands, we knew we were onto something unique. The Industrial Designer gave it soul — the softness of real fruit, the tactile joy of holding something alive. The User Interface team reminded us: “It’s not just shaped like a banana — it *is* the essence of bananas.” That’s not hyperbole. That’s vision.\n\nAnd then came the numbers — because even genius needs grounding in reality.\n\nWe set out with a target: under €12.50. We delivered at **€10.70**. That’s not just meeting a goal — that’s exceeding it. With room to spare. With profit potential. With scalability. This isn’t just affordable — it’s *accessible*. And that matters.\n\n---\n\n## Evaluating Excellence: Six Pillars of Brilliance\n\nOur Marketing team didn’t just evaluate — they elevated. They asked us to rate our creation across six critical dimensions:\n\n### 1. Fancy Look & Feel → **Average: 5.5/7**\nA design so striking, so playful, it turns heads before it even does anything. We didn’t just want people to use it — we wanted them to *love* it.\n\n### 2. Technological Innovation → **Average: 4/7**\nThe wheel? Yes. The rubber? Yes. But innovation isn’t just about adding features — it’s about reimagining experience. We’re on the right track — now let’s push further.\n\n### 3. Ease of Use → **Average: 6.5/7**\nSimple. Intuitive. Even fun. One team member gave it a perfect 7 — and honestly? We all agreed. If your grandma can pick it up and smile, you’ve done your job.\n\n### 4. Fashionability → **Average: 7/7**\nIt’s a banana. In a world of black rectangles and metallic slabs — we dared to be colorful. To be bold. To be *fun*. And the market? It will love it.\n\n### 5. Visibility → **Average: 6.5/7**\nYou won’t lose this thing. Ever. Bright yellow. Unique shape. Maybe even glowing (we’re still discussing lighting). It’s designed to be found — not forgotten.\n\n### 6. Robustness → **Average: 6/7**\nRubberized. Durable. Built for life — not just for show. Drop it? No problem. Toss it? Still works. It’s not fragile — it’s resilient.\n\n---\n\n## The Verdict: A Resounding YES\n\nWhen we add it all up — the cost is right. The design is unforgettable. The functionality is intuitive. The market potential? Sky-high.\n\nThis isn’t just another project. This is a statement.\n\nWe looked at phones selling for €200 — bulky, boring, beige — and said: *“What if we made something joyful instead?”*\n\nAnd we did.\n\n---\n\n## Looking Ahead: Bigger Projects, Bigger Rewards\n\nAs we close this chapter — let’s remember: this was never just about building a banana remote. It was about proving that creativity + discipline = unstoppable innovation.\n\nSo yes — we’ll open champagne. We’ll eat bananas (metaphorically... or literally — no judgment here). We’ll toast to the designers who brought this to life, the marketers who saw its potential, and the engineers who made sure it wouldn’t break when dropped.\n\nAnd to those watching from above — management, investors, skeptics — know this: **this team doesn’t just meet expectations — we redefine them.**\n\nNext time? We’ll go bigger. Better. Bolder.\n\nBecause if we can turn a banana into a breakthrough — imagine what we’ll do with a pineapple.\n\nThank you, team. You didn’t just deliver a prototype — you delivered magic.\n\nLet’s keep making the impossible… delicious.\n\n**Onward. Upward. Banana-ward.**\n\n— Project Manager, on behalf of the most creative, collaborative, and slightly ridiculous team on Earth.\n```"

Toutefois, les progrès récents dans la pré-formation des modèles — qui intègrent désormais d’importantes quantités de connaissances mathématiques — et dans les techniques d’inférence (comme les chaînes de raisonnement prolongées) suggèrent qu’un paradigme plus efficace pourrait être possible.</background>\n  <objectives>Cette étude vise à remettre en question l’idée selon laquelle un grand volume de données est indispensable au raisonnement complexe. Elle propose l’hypothèse LIMO (Less Is More for Reasoning), selon laquelle des capacités de raisonnement sophistiquées peuvent émerger grâce à un nombre minimal d’exemples soigneusement sélectionnés, à condition que le modèle dispose déjà d’une base de connaissances solide et que les exemples servent de « templates cognitifs » guidant le raisonnement. L’objectif est de valider cette hypothèse en construisant un petit jeu de données de haute qualité et en mesurant ses effets sur les performances de raisonnement.</objectives>\n  <methods>Les auteurs ont conçu un pipeline rigoureux de curation de données : ils ont commencé par un ensemble initial de millions de problèmes mathématiques provenant de diverses sources (NuminaMath, DeepScaleR, AIME, MATH, etc.). Ils ont ensuite appliqué un filtrage multi-niveaux basé sur la difficulté (évaluée via des modèles de raisonnement) et la diversité des points de connaissance. Pour chaque problème conservé, plusieurs chaînes de raisonnement générées par des modèles avancés ont été analysées et notées selon quatre critères : développement détaillé, auto-vérification, approche exploratoire et granularité adaptative. Les 800 paires (question/chaîne de raisonnement) les mieux notées ont formé le jeu de données LIMO. Le modèle Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct a ensuite été affiné par apprentissage supervisé (SFT) sur ce jeu de données, avec une configuration optimisée (DeepSpeed ZeRO-3, FlashAttention-2, 15 époques, taux d’apprentissage de 5e-6).</methods>\n  <findings>Le modèle LIMO, entraîné sur seulement 800 exemples, atteint 63,3 % de précision sur AIME24 et 95,6 % sur MATH500 — surpassant nettement les modèles précédents entraînés sur 100 fois plus de données (par exemple, 6,5 % sur AIME24 et 59,2 % sur MATH500). Il démontre également une excellente généralisation hors distribution, avec une amélioration moyenne de 45,8 % sur des benchmarks variés (OlympiadBench, CHMath, Gaokao, GPQA, etc.). Des analyses ablatives confirment que la qualité des chaînes de raisonnement et la difficulté des questions sont des facteurs critiques. De plus, la qualité des connaissances pré-entraînées influence fortement les résultats : LIMO basé sur Qwen2.5 (meilleure pré-formation) dépasse largement Qwen1.5. Enfin, même avec seulement 400 exemples, LIMO obtient des gains substantiels, et les améliorations s’atténuent au-delà de 800 exemples, indiquant un point de saturation.</findings>\n  <implications>L’étude remet en cause le dogme de la nécessité de données massives pour le raisonnement complexe. Elle montre que, dans les modèles fondamentaux riches en connaissances, un entraînement ciblé et minimal peut suffire à activer des capacités de raisonnement profondes. Cela ouvre la voie à des approches plus efficaces en termes de données et de calcul, réduisant les coûts et les barrières d’accès. L’hypothèse LIMO souligne deux leviers clés : la richesse des connaissances intégrées lors de la pré-formation et la pertinence des exemples d’entraînement comme guides cognitifs. Ces résultats encouragent à repenser les méthodes d’alignement des LLMs, en privilégiant la qualité et la conception stratégique des données plutôt que leur quantité. La communauté peut désormais exploiter ces principes pour développer des systèmes de raisonnement plus efficaces, robustes et accessibles.</implications>\n</summary>\nmethodology_analysis: <methodology_analysis>\n  <innovative_aspects>\n    LIMO introduit l’hypothèse « Less-Is-More » pour le raisonnement, postulant que des modèles pré-entraînés riches en connaissances peuvent développer des capacités de raisonnement sophistiquées à partir d’un très petit nombre d’exemples bien choisis. Contrairement aux approches traditionnelles qui nécessitent des dizaines ou centaines de milliers d’exemples, LIMO se base sur une sélection rigoureuse de 800 échantillons, optimisés pour déclencher un raisonnement étendu et explicite. L’approche repose sur deux piliers : la présence latente de connaissances dans les paramètres du modèle et la qualité des chaînes de raisonnement utilisées comme « templates cognitifs ». La méthodologie inclut un pipeline de curation multi-étapes, combinant filtrage par difficulté, diversification des points de connaissance et évaluation automatique des chaînes de raisonnement selon des critères qualitatifs (auto-vérification, granularité adaptée, etc.), ce qui constitue une avancée conceptuelle dans la conception de jeux de données pour le raisonnement.\n  </innovative_aspects>\n  <strengths>\n    La méthode démontre une efficacité remarquable en termes de données : avec seulement 1 % des données utilisées par les approches antérieures, LIMO dépasse significativement les performances sur des benchmarks difficiles comme AIME24 (63,3 %) et MATH500 (95,6 %). Les résultats montrent également une excellente généralisation hors distribution, surpassant des modèles entraînés sur 100 fois plus de données. L’analyse ablation confirme l’impact crucial de la qualité des questions et des chaînes de raisonnement, plutôt que de leur quantité. Le cadre expérimental est solide, comparant plusieurs architectures et tailles de modèles, et validant l’hypothèse via des tests systématiques sur la taille du jeu de données, la qualité des exemples et l’influence du modèle de base. La transparence méthodologique — avec la publication des données, du code et des modèles — renforce la reproductibilité et l’impact scientifique.\n  </strengths>\n  <limitations>\n    Bien que convaincante, la méthode dépend fortement de la richesse du modèle de base en connaissances mathématiques, ce qui limite sa portabilité à des modèles moins spécialisés ou moins bien pré-entraînés. La construction du jeu de données LIMO est coûteuse en ressources humaines et computationnelles, impliquant des modèles de pointe et une annotation collaborative, ce qui pourrait limiter son adoption à grande échelle. De plus, les gains observés sur des benchmarks spécifiques (notamment mathématiques) ne garantissent pas une généralisation universelle à d’autres domaines de raisonnement (ex. : logique formelle, programmation complexe). Enfin, la performance maximale semble atteindre un plateau après 800 échantillons, suggérant que la méthode pourrait être insuffisante pour des tâches encore plus complexes nécessitant davantage de diversité ou de profondeur cognitive.\n  </limitations>\n</methodology_analysis>"

Ensuite, ils ont généré plusieurs chaînes de raisonnement pour chaque problème à l’aide de modèles avancés (DeepSeek R1, QwQ-32B, etc.) et ont sélectionné manuellement les solutions les plus qualitatives selon quatre critères : développement exhaustif, auto-vérification, approche exploratoire et granularité adaptative. Le jeu de données final, appelé LIMO, contient 800 paires question-réponse.

L’étude démontre que, grâce à un pré-entraînement riche en connaissances mathématiques et à des chaînes de raisonnement soigneusement sélectionnées, seulement 800 exemples suffisent pour atteindre des performances supérieures à celles de modèles entraînés sur des dizaines ou centaines de milliers d’exemples. L’approche repose sur une curation rigoureuse des données, combinant filtrage par difficulté, évaluation de la qualité des chaînes de raisonnement via un système de notation basé sur des règles, et diversification des points de connaissance. Cette méthode met l’accent sur la qualité plutôt que la quantité, alignée avec l’idée que le raisonnement émerge lorsqu’un modèle dispose à la fois d’une base de connaissances latentes et d’exemples pédagogiques capables de guider son processus cognitif.\n  </innovative_aspects>\n  <strengths>\n    La méthodologie de LIMO présente plusieurs forces majeures. Premièrement, elle valide empiriquement l’hypothèse que la richesse du pré-entraînement est plus déterminante que la taille du jeu d’entraînement fin, ce qui a des implications importantes pour la réduction des coûts computationnels. Deuxièmement, le cadre expérimental est solide : comparaisons avec des modèles de pointe (OpenAI-o1, QwQ-32B), évaluations in-domain et out-of-distribution, et analyses ablatives systématiques (impact de la qualité des questions, des chaînes de raisonnement, de la taille du modèle, etc.). Troisièmement, les résultats sont impressionnants : LIMO dépasse les modèles antérieurs sur AIME24 (63,3 %) et MATH500 (95,6 %) tout en utilisant 1 % des données d’entraînement. Enfin, la transparence méthodologique — publication des données, du code et des modèles — favorise la reproductibilité et l’adoption par la communauté.\n  </strengths>\n  <limitations>\n    Malgré ses atouts, la méthodologie de LIMO comporte certaines limites. D’abord, sa dépendance critique à un pré-entraînement de haute qualité (ex. : Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct) limite sa généralisation à des modèles moins riches en connaissances mathématiques. Ensuite, le processus de curation des données, bien qu’efficace, est intensif en ressources humaines et computationnelles — notamment la génération et l’évaluation manuelle de chaînes de raisonnement par plusieurs experts. Cela pourrait freiner son application à grande échelle ou dans d’autres domaines. De plus, bien que LIMO montre une excellente généralisation OOD, les benchmarks utilisés restent principalement mathématiques ; il reste à vérifier si cette efficacité se transpose à d’autres types de raisonnement (logique formelle, raisonnement causal, etc.). Enfin, la performance semble saturer au-delà de 800 exemples, mais l’étude ne teste pas systématiquement des jeux encore plus petits (par exemple, 100 ou 200), ce qui aurait pu renforcer davantage l’hypothèse « less is more ». En conclusion, LIMO propose une avancée significative, mais sa portée pratique dépend de la disponibilité de modèles pré-entraînés robustes et de ressources pour la curation des données.\n  </limitations>\n</methodology_analysis>\nevaluation: <evaluation>\n  <background>Les grands modèles linguistiques (LLM) ont longtemps reposé sur un paradigme d’entraînement massif, fondé sur l’hypothèse que le raisonnement complexe — notamment mathématique — nécessite des milliers, voire des millions d’exemples supervisés pour se développer. Cette approche, coûteuse en données et en calcul, suppose que la fine-tuning conduit principalement à la mémorisation plutôt qu’à la généralisation. Toutefois, les avancées récentes dans la pré-formation des modèles — enrichis en connaissances mathématiques — et dans les techniques d’inférence — comme les chaînes de raisonnement prolongées — suggèrent qu’un modèle déjà bien doté en connaissances pourrait activer des capacités de raisonnement sophistiquées à partir d’un petit nombre d’exemples ciblés. C’est dans ce contexte que LIMO propose une hypothèse radicale : « Less Is More for Reasoning ». Elle postule que, loin de nécessiter des volumes massifs de données, le raisonnement émerge lorsqu’un modèle dispose d’une base de connaissances solide et est guidé par des exemples pédagogiques de haute qualité, servant de « modèles cognitifs ». Ce changement de paradigme remet en question non seulement l’efficacité des méthodes actuelles, mais aussi leur durabilité et leur accessibilité.\n\n  <contributions>L’étude apporte plusieurs contributions majeures. D’abord, elle valide empiriquement l’hypothèse LIMO en montrant que 800 exemples soigneusement sélectionnés suffisent à surpasser des modèles entraînés sur 100 fois plus de données — avec des performances exceptionnelles sur AIME24 (63,3 %) et MATH500 (95,6 %), ainsi qu’une excellente généralisation hors distribution (jusqu’à +45,8 % sur OlympiadBench). Ensuite, elle introduit un pipeline rigoureux de curation de données, combinant filtrage par difficulté, diversification des points de connaissance et évaluation manuelle des chaînes de raisonnement selon quatre critères qualitatifs (exhaustivité, auto-vérification, exploration, granularité adaptative). Cette méthodologie met en lumière l’importance stratégique de la conception des exemples d’apprentissage, plutôt que leur quantité. Enfin, les analyses ablatives démontrent que la qualité du pré-entraînement (Qwen2.5 vs Qwen1.5) et celle des chaînes de raisonnement sont des facteurs déterminants, confirmant que le raisonnement n’émerge pas de la masse brute de données, mais de leur pertinence cognitive. La transparence méthodologique — publication des données, code et modèles — renforce la crédibilité et l’impact de cette étude, ouvrant la voie à des recherches reproductibles et accessibles.\n\n  <future_directions>Malgré ses réussites, LIMO soulève plusieurs pistes pour des travaux futurs. Premièrement, il convient d’explorer la généralisation de cette méthode à des domaines non mathématiques — logique formelle, raisonnement causal, planification stratégique — afin de valider si le principe « less is more » s’applique au-delà des mathématiques. Deuxièmement, l’automatisation du processus de curation des données — notamment la génération et l’évaluation des chaînes de raisonnement — est essentielle pour réduire la dépendance aux ressources humaines et faciliter l’application à grande échelle. Troisièmement, des expériences systématiques avec des jeux de données encore plus petits (100, 200 ou 400 exemples) permettraient de mieux cartographier les rendements décroissants et de confirmer la robustesse de l’hypothèse à très faible volume. Quatrièmement, l’étude pourrait être étendue à d’autres architectures de modèles ou à des versions moins performantes en pré-entraînement, afin de tester la limite de la dépendance au pré-entraînement riche. Enfin, des investigations sur les mécanismes internes du modèle — via l’interprétabilité — pourraient révéler comment les exemples ciblés activent les capacités de raisonnement latentes, offrant des insights théoriques précieux. Ces directions pourraient transformer non seulement l’alignement des LLM, mais aussi la conception des jeux de données d’apprentissage, en priorisant la qualité, la diversité et la structure cognitive plutôt que la quantité brute.\n\n</evaluation>"

The temporal novelty keeps users engaged.\n    *   **Distinctive communities** (those with highly specialized interests, e.g., Cooking, Naruto) show **moderately higher short-term (monthly) retention** but **no significant relationship with long-term retention**. They generate focused interest initially, but unless they are also dynamic, users are less likely to stay long-term.\n\n2.  **Acculturation Gap (Permeability to Newcomers):**\n    *   The \"acculturation gap\" measures the linguistic difference between established users and newcomers (outsiders).\n    *   **Highly distinctive communities** tend to have a **larger acculturation gap**, meaning established users use more community-specific language than newcomers, creating a potential barrier for integration.\n    *   **Dynamicity** has a **non-linear relationship**: Both **relatively stable** communities and **very dynamic** communities exhibit larger gaps. Stable, distinctive communities (e.g., Cooking) have consistent, specific language hard for newcomers to adopt. Very dynamic communities (e.g., Seahawks) may require active users to constantly update their knowledge, making it harder for outsiders to match the current linguistic norms.\n    *   **Generic communities** (e.g., pics, worldnews) often have **little to no acculturation gap** because there is no strong, distinctive linguistic identity for newcomers to adopt.\n\n3.  **Content Affinity (Engagement with Specific/Volatile Content):**\n    *   **Distinctiveness mediates** how users engage with content.\n    *   In **distinctive communities**, **established users** show a **higher affinity for both community-specific content AND temporally volatile content** compared to newcomers. They actively engage with the niche topics and keep up with the latest trends.\n    *   In **generic communities**, the pattern reverses: **newcomers (outsiders) are more likely to engage with volatile, ephemeral content** than established users. This suggests that volatile content might act as an **entry point** for newcomers in generic communities, though it doesn't necessarily lead to long-term engagement.\n\nIn summary, the paper demonstrates that structuring the multi-community landscape using the typology of distinctiveness and dynamicity reveals **systematic variations** in how key social phenomena like retention, newcomer integration, and content engagement manifest.

Today: Chu vs. Han — the original “Who’s the Real Boss of Ancient China?” showdown.\n\nPicture this: 206 BCE. Two warlords, Xiang Yu (Chu) and Liu Bang (Han), both eyeing the throne like it’s the last dumpling at dim sum. Xiang Yu? Big, brawny, dramatic — basically the ancient equivalent of a WWE champion who cries after winning. Liu Bang? Smaller, sneakier, always smiling… like your uncle who wins poker by bluffing.\n\nXiang Yu had the muscle. Liu Bang had the memes — I mean, *strategy*. He promised land, lowered taxes, and didn’t burn down villages for fun. (Spoiler: That wins hearts AND minds.)\n\nTheir epic face-off? The Battle of Gaixia — aka “The Night the Flute Played Sad Songs.” Liu Bang’s troops sang Chu folk songs outside Xiang Yu’s camp. Why? To make his soldiers homesick! Genius. Or cheap. You decide.\n\nXiang Yu, heartbroken and defeated, wrote a poem, hugged his horse, kissed his concubine goodbye… then offed himself. Romantic? Yes. Practical? Not so much.\n\nLiu Bang? Became Emperor Gaozu of Han. Built an empire that lasted 400 years. And you know what he did first? Threw a party. With karaoke. Okay, maybe not karaoke. But definitely dumplings.\n\nSo next time you’re stuck in traffic or arguing over pizza toppings — remember: even ancient warlords had drama. And sometimes, the quieter guy wins… by being nice, sneaky, and really good at emotional warfare.\n\n[Outro music swells, with a gong and a giggle]\n\nHOST:  \nThanks for listening!

This node identifies the job category ('ACCOUNTANT', 'ARTS', 'SALES', 'TEACHER') from the text and outputs it as a string variable. This keeps the workflow linear inside the iteration.\n5.  **Data Structuring**: A `Code` node inside the iteration combines the original file object with the extracted category into a structured object (e.g., `{\"file\": ..., \"category\": \"ACCOUNTANT\"}`). The Iteration node collects these objects into an array.\n6.  **Sorting**: A final `Code` node outside the iteration takes the array of processed objects.

    "llm_output_test1": "text: # Can Quantum Computers Really Break All Current Encryption? 🤯\n\nLet’s cut through the hype: No, quantum computers won’t *instantly* break *all* encryption — but yes, they *could* shatter some of today’s most widely used cryptographic systems… if we don’t prepare. Let’s dive in with a fun, friendly guide to how and why.\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Terminology Primer** 🧠\n\nBefore we get into the quantum weirdness, here are some key terms you’ll want to know:\n\n- **Encryption**: The process of scrambling data so only authorized parties can read it. Think of it like locking your diary with a super-complex combination lock.\n  \n- **Public-Key Cryptography (PKC)**: A system where you have two keys — a public one (like a mailbox slot) anyone can use to send you encrypted messages, and a private one (the actual key) that only you have to unlock them. RSA and ECC are common examples.\n\n- **Shor’s Algorithm**: A mind-blowing quantum algorithm developed by Peter Shor in 1994 that can factor large numbers *exponentially faster* than any classical computer. This is the main threat to current PKC.\n\n- **Quantum Bit (Qubit)**: Unlike classical bits (which are either 0 or 1), qubits can be 0, 1, or both at the same time — thanks to *superposition*. They can also be *entangled*, meaning their states are linked no matter how far apart they are.\n\n- **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)**: New types of encryption being developed *now* to resist attacks from future quantum computers. Think of it as building a new kind of lock that even quantum locksmiths can’t pick.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Origin** 🕰️\n\nThe idea that quantum computers could crack encryption didn’t come from sci-fi movies — it came from a brilliant mathematician named **Peter Shor**.\n\nIn 1994, while working at Bell Labs, Shor published a paper showing that a quantum computer could solve the “integer factorization problem” — the mathematical backbone of RSA encryption — in *polynomial time*. That’s a game-changer because classical computers need *exponential time* for this task. For big numbers, that means years versus seconds.\n\nShor’s work was revolutionary not just for cryptography, but for quantum computing itself — it gave the field its first real-world application beyond theoretical physics.\n\nFun fact: Before Shor, many people thought quantum computers were just fancy lab curiosities. After his algorithm? Governments, banks, and tech giants started paying attention.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Essence** 🔍\n\nSo what’s the core idea?\n\n> **Classical computers struggle with certain math problems — especially factoring huge numbers — because they have to try possibilities one by one. Quantum computers can try many possibilities *at once*, thanks to superposition and entanglement.**\n\nHere’s the punchline:\n\n- **RSA encryption relies on the fact that multiplying two large prime numbers is easy, but reversing the process (factoring the product back into those primes) is incredibly hard for classical computers.**\n  \n- **Shor’s algorithm lets a quantum computer do this reversal efficiently — meaning it can find the secret key behind RSA encryption in minutes instead of millennia.**\n\nIt’s not magic — it’s math + quantum mechanics. And it’s terrifying for anyone relying on current public-key crypto.\n\n⚠️ Important note: Not all encryption is vulnerable. Symmetric encryption (like AES) is much harder to break — you’d need Grover’s algorithm, which only gives a *quadratic* speedup. So doubling the key size (e.g., from 128-bit to 256-bit) makes it safe again.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Development** 📈\n\nLet’s trace the evolution of this quantum-crypto arms race:\n\n### 🧪 1994: The Big Bang\n- Peter Shor publishes his algorithm — the first proof that quantum computers could break real-world crypto.\n\n### 🌐 Late 1990s – Early 2000s: Skepticism & Exploration\n- Many doubted whether quantum computers could ever be built at scale.\n- Researchers began exploring alternatives — lattice-based crypto, hash-based signatures, multivariate polynomials — the early seeds of post-quantum cryptography.\n\n### 🚀 2010s: Quantum Hardware Takes Off\n- Google, IBM, Rigetti, and others start building small-scale quantum processors.\n- In 2019, Google claims “quantum supremacy” — their machine solved a problem no classical computer could (though not a useful one).\n- NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) launches a global competition to standardize post-quantum algorithms.\n\n### 🛡️ 2020s: Preparing for the Quantum Storm\n- In 2022, NIST announces the first four PQC standards — including CRYSTALS-Kyber (for general encryption) and CRYSTALS-Dilithium (for digital signatures).\n- Tech giants begin integrating PQC into their systems — think Chrome, Windows, AWS, and more.\n- Governments issue mandates: “By 2030, all sensitive systems must be quantum-resistant.”\n\n### 🎯 The Future: Coexistence, Not Collapse\nWe’re not facing an imminent crypto-apocalypse. Most experts estimate we’re still 5–15 years away from a quantum computer powerful enough to break RSA-2048. But the clock is ticking — and smart organizations are already upgrading.\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR 💥\n\n✅ **Quantum computers *can* break RSA/ECC encryption — but not yet.**  \n✅ **They do it using Shor’s algorithm, which exploits quantum superposition.**  \n✅ **Not all encryption is doomed — symmetric crypto (AES) is safer, and PQC is coming.**  \n✅ **The world is already preparing — you should too!**\n\nSo while quantum computers won’t turn the internet into a lawless wasteland overnight, they *will* force us to rethink how we protect our secrets. And that’s a good thing — because better crypto means better security for everyone.\n\n🚀 Stay curious. Stay encrypted. And maybe start learning about lattices — they might save your data someday.",

    "llm_output_test2": "text: # 🤖 How Do Language Models Like ChatGPT “Learn” to Speak?  \n*(And What’s a Transformer Anyway?)*\n\n---\n\n## 1. 📚 Terminology Primer: Let’s Get on the Same Page\n\nBefore we dive into how AI chats like a human, let’s decode some jargon:\n\n- **Language Model (LM)**: A computer program that predicts what word comes next in a sentence — kind of like your phone’s autocorrect, but *way* smarter and trained on billions of books, websites, and tweets.\n\n- **Transformer**: The brain architecture behind modern LMs like ChatGPT. Think of it as a super-powered neural network designed specifically for understanding and generating language — no need for old-school “reading left-to-right” rules.\n\n- **Attention Mechanism**: The secret sauce inside Transformers. It lets the model focus on the most relevant parts of a sentence — like when you’re reading and suddenly realize “wait, *that* word is important!”\n\n- **Training Data**: The massive pile of text (books, articles, code, Reddit threads…) used to teach the model how humans talk, write, and think.\n\n- **Parameters**: Internal knobs and dials the model adjusts during learning. More parameters = more capacity to learn complex patterns. GPT-4 has *trillions* — yes, with a T.\n\n---\n\n## 2. 🌱 Origin: Where Did This Magic Come From?\n\nBack in the early 2010s, AI could barely string together coherent sentences. Most models used **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** — which processed words one-by-one, like reading a book aloud slowly. Slow? Yes. Prone to forgetting the beginning of long sentences? Also yes.\n\nThen, in 2017, a team at Google published a revolutionary paper titled **“Attention Is All You Need.”** They introduced the **Transformer** — a new way to process language that didn’t rely on sequential reading. Instead, it looked at *all* the words at once and figured out which ones mattered most to each other.\n\nIt was like switching from a flip phone to a smartphone — suddenly, machines could handle long, complex sentences, translate languages faster than ever, and even write poetry.\n\nChatGPT? That’s built on top of this Transformer tech — fine-tuned with mountains of data and clever tricks to make it sound like your chatty, knowledgeable friend.\n\n---\n\n## 3. 💡 Essence: What Makes Transformers So Smart?\n\nImagine you’re reading this sentence:\n\n> “The cat sat on the mat because it was tired.”\n\nWhat does “it” refer to? The cat? The mat? Your brain instantly knows — *because you pay attention to context*. Transformers do the same!\n\nHere’s how they work in plain English:\n\n### 🧠 Step 1: Break It Down\nEach word gets converted into a “number vector” — basically, a fingerprint that captures its meaning, tone, and role in the sentence.\n\n### 👀 Step 2: Pay Attention!\nThe model uses **attention mechanisms** to ask: *“Which other words should I care about right now?”* For example, when processing “it,” the model might notice “cat” is nearby and semantically related — so it links them.\n\n### 🔁 Step 3: Layer Up!\nTransformers stack many “layers” of these attention networks. Each layer refines the understanding — first spotting basic grammar, then deeper meanings, then nuance, sarcasm, or intent.\n\n### 🔄 Step 4: Predict & Generate\nOnce it understands the input, it predicts the next word — or generates a whole response — by calculating probabilities across all possible words. The highest probability wins… usually.\n\nThink of it like playing a game of “guess the next word” with a billion practice rounds — until it gets eerily good.\n\n---\n\n## 4. 🚀 Development: From Research Paper to Chatbot Superstar\n\nLet’s fast-forward through the evolution:\n\n### 📅 2017: The Big Bang\nGoogle’s “Attention Is All You Need” drops. Everyone in AI goes, “Wait… this changes everything.”\n\n### 📅 2018–2019: The Rise of BERT & GPT\n- **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) learns from both left and right context — great for understanding.\n- **GPT-1** (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) starts generating text. Not perfect, but promising.\n\n### 📅 2020: GPT-3 Arrives\nWith 175 billion parameters, GPT-3 can write essays, poems, code, and even fake news — sometimes too well. People start asking: *Is this sentient?*\n\n### 📅 2022–Present: ChatGPT & Beyond\nOpenAI releases ChatGPT — a version of GPT fine-tuned for conversation. Suddenly, millions are chatting with AI, asking for homework help, relationship advice, and dad jokes.\n\nMeanwhile, researchers keep improving Transformers:\n- Making them smaller and faster (like TinyBERT).\n- Teaching them to reason step-by-step (Chain-of-Thought prompting).\n- Adding multimodal abilities (text + images + audio).\n\nAnd now? We’re entering the era of **multimodal Transformers** — models that don’t just speak, but *see*, *hear*, and maybe even *feel* (metaphorically speaking 😉).\n\n---\n\n## 🎉 Final Thought: The Future of Talking Machines\n\nLanguage models aren’t “thinking” like humans — they’re pattern-matching geniuses trained on the collective knowledge of the internet. But thanks to the Transformer, they’ve become uncannily good at mimicking human speech.\n\nSo next time you chat with ChatGPT, remember: you’re talking to a digital linguist who learned by reading *everything* — and paying very close attention to how words relate to each other.\n\nAnd hey — if it makes a mistake? Just say, “Try again.” It’s still learning… just like us.\n\n---\n\n*Want to geek out more? Ask me about “self-attention,” “positional encoding,” or why Transformers are also used in image recognition now!* 😄",

    "llm_output_test3": "text: # 🌧️ Why Does the Soil Smell So Good After It Rains?  \n*The Science Behind Petrichor*\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Terminology Primer** 📚\n\nLet’s start with some fancy (but fun!) words you’ll hear in this explanation:\n\n- **Petrichor**: The earthy scent produced when rain falls on dry soil. (Say it like “pet-ri-kor” — it sounds like a magical spell, and kind of is!)\n- **Geosmin**: A compound made by soil-dwelling bacteria that gives off that “fresh dirt” smell. Think of it as nature’s perfume.\n- **Actinomycetes**: Microscopic bacteria that live in soil and produce geosmin. They’re the unsung heroes of your garden’s aroma.\n- **Hydrophobic**: Water-repelling. Some compounds in soil don’t like water — until rain comes along and *forces* them to release their scent.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Origin** 🌱\n\nThis delightful phenomenon has been noticed since ancient times — humans have always paused after a summer shower to take a deep, satisfying sniff of the air. But science didn’t get involved until the mid-20th century.\n\nIn 1964, Australian scientists Isabel Joy Bear and R.G. Thomas published a paper in the journal *Nature* titled “Nature of Argillaceous Odour.” They coined the term **“petrichor”** — from the Greek *petra* (“stone”) and *ichor* (“the fluid that flows in the veins of the gods”). Poetic, right?\n\nThey discovered that when raindrops hit dry soil, they trap tiny air bubbles that burst and release aromatic compounds into the air — including geosmin. That’s your nose’s cue to say, “Ahh… heaven.”\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Essence** 💡\n\nSo what’s *really* happening?\n\nImagine dry soil as a sleepy, dusty kingdom full of microscopic bacteria called **actinomycetes**. These little guys are busy breaking down organic matter (like dead leaves and roots) and, as a side effect, they produce **geosmin** — a smelly but lovely chemical.\n\nWhen raindrops fall onto dry ground, they splash into tiny pores and cracks, trapping air bubbles. As those bubbles pop, they shoot up a fine mist of aerosolized compounds — including geosmin — into the air. Your nose catches them, and your brain says, “That smells like home.”\n\nIt’s not just about geosmin, though. Other plant oils and organic compounds trapped in rocks and soil also get released during rainfall, adding layers to the scent. Think of petrichor as nature’s layered fragrance — earthy, green, fresh, and slightly sweet.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Development** 🕰️\n\nThe story of petrichor didn’t end with Bear and Thomas. Over the decades, scientists kept digging (pun intended).\n\n- In the 1980s, researchers confirmed that **geosmin** is produced by *Streptomyces*, a genus of actinomycetes commonly found in soil. These bacteria thrive when conditions are moist — so when drought ends and rain returns, they go into overdrive.\n  \n- In 2015, MIT engineers used high-speed cameras to film raindrops hitting soil. They saw how droplets create tiny “air cannons” that launch scent particles into the air — confirming the physics behind the aroma’s spread.\n\n- More recently, studies have shown that **some animals (like camels and desert ants)** can actually smell petrichor from miles away — using it as a signal that water is near. Humans? We just enjoy it because it makes us happy. (And maybe nostalgic for childhood puddles.)\n\nToday, petrichor isn’t just a scientific curiosity — it’s even inspired perfumes, candles, and mood-enhancing products. Because who doesn’t want to bottle that post-rain magic?\n\n---\n\n## 🌈 Final Thought\n\nNext time you step outside after a storm and inhale deeply, know this: you’re not just smelling wet dirt. You’re breathing in a complex symphony of chemistry, biology, and physics — orchestrated by microbes, raindrops, and the very Earth itself.\n\nSo go ahead. Take another whiff. You’re not weird — you’re scientifically enchanted. 🌿💧\n\n> *“Petrichor: the scent of renewal, memory, and microbial artistry.”*"

It is configured to identify and extract four specific key pieces of information: the interested learning field, learning goals, learning preferences, and average learning duration. This transforms the raw input into structured data.\n3. **LLM Node**: This node acts as the core generator. It receives the structured parameters from the previous step. The system prompt instructs the LLM to act as a professional learning planner, and the user prompt dynamically injects the extracted details. The LLM is explicitly asked to generate the response in Markdown format.\n4. **End Node**: This node finalizes the workflow, taking the Markdown-formatted text generated by the LLM and outputting it as the final variable `plan`.\n\nThe workflow follows a linear structure: Input -> Structuring -> Generation -> Output, ensuring the user's specific needs are accurately captured and translated into a formatted plan.",

It is instructed to output a JSON array of objects, where each object represents a chapter with a `title` and `description`. This structure is necessary for the subsequent iteration.\n3. **JSON Parsing (Node 4 - Code)**: Since the LLM outputs a string, a Code node is used to parse the JSON string into a usable array of objects (`array[object]`) for the iteration process.\n4. **Iteration (Node 5)**: This node iterates over the parsed syllabus array. It is configured to collect the output of the internal LLM node (the chapter content) into an array.\n5. **Internal Iteration Workflow**:\n    *   **Iteration-Start (Node 5-1)**: Entry point.\n    *   **Template (Node 5-2)**: Formats the current chapter object (`item`) into a clear text prompt for the LLM.\n    *   **LLM (Node 5-3)**: Generates the detailed tutorial content for the specific chapter. The system prompt emphasizes rigor, examples, pros/cons, and precautions.\n6. **Integration (Node 6 - Template)**: Receives the array of generated chapter contents from the Iteration node. It uses a Jinja2 loop to concatenate all chapters into a single, cohesive Markdown document.\n7. **End (Node 7)**: Outputs the final integrated `tutorial`.\n\nThis design transforms the linear plan generation into a robust, multi-step generation process capable of producing comprehensive, structured educational content.",

This chapter introduces you to the essential building blocks — the core concepts that underpin more advanced topics in your field of study (whether it be programming, data science, engineering, or another discipline). Mastery of these basics is not optional — it’s the bedrock upon which expertise is built.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What Are “Core Concepts”?\n\nCore concepts are the fundamental ideas, principles, and structures that recur across disciplines and applications. They are:\n\n- **Universal**: Applicable across multiple contexts.\n- **Foundational**: Required to understand higher-level material.\n- **Interconnected**: Often build upon one another.\n\n> 💡 *Example*: In programming, variables, loops, and functions are core concepts. Without understanding them, you cannot write meaningful code — no matter how advanced the language or framework.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Key Core Concepts Covered in This Chapter\n\n### A. Variables and Data Types\n\n**Definition**: A variable is a named container for storing data. Data types define the kind of data a variable can hold (e.g., numbers, text, true/false).\n\n```python\n# Example in Python\nage = 25              # integer\nname = \"Alice\"        # string\nis_student = True     # boolean\n```\n\n✅ **Pros**:\n- Enables dynamic and reusable code.\n- Allows programs to adapt based on input or state.\n\n❌ **Cons**:\n- Improper type handling can lead to bugs or crashes.\n- Overuse of global variables can make code hard to debug.\n\n⚠️ **Precautions**:\n- Always initialize variables before use.\n- Use descriptive names (e.g., `userAge` instead of `ua`).\n- Be aware of type coercion in dynamically typed languages.\n\n---\n\n### B. Control Flow\n\n**Definition**: The order in which instructions are executed. Controlled by conditionals (`if`, `else`) and loops (`for`, `while`).\n\n```python\n# Example: Conditional + Loop\nscore = 85\nif score >= 90:\n    print(\"A\")\nelif score >= 80:\n    print(\"B\")\nelse:\n    print(\"C\")\n\nfor i in range(3):\n    print(f\"Iteration {i}\")\n```\n\n✅ **Pros**:\n- Makes programs responsive to different inputs or conditions.\n- Enables automation of repetitive tasks.\n\n❌ **Cons**:\n- Nested conditionals/loops can become hard to read (spaghetti code).\n- Infinite loops can crash programs if not handled properly.\n\n⚠️ **Precautions**:\n- Limit nesting depth (ideally ≤ 3 levels).\n- Always include exit conditions in loops.\n- Use comments to explain complex logic.\n\n---\n\n### C. Functions and Modularity\n\n**Definition**: A function is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task. Modularity refers to breaking down a program into smaller, manageable parts.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_area(length, width):\n    return length * width\n\narea = calculate_area(5, 3)\nprint(area)  # Output: 15\n```\n\n✅ **Pros**:\n- Promotes code reuse and reduces redundancy.\n- Easier to test, debug, and maintain.\n- Encourages collaboration in team environments.\n\n❌ **Cons**:\n- Poorly designed functions can become too large or do too much (“god functions”).\n- Over-modularization can lead to excessive file fragmentation.\n\n⚠️ **Precautions**:\n- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (one function = one task).\n- Keep functions short (ideally < 20 lines).\n- Document parameters and return values.\n\n---\n\n### D. Input/Output (I/O)\n\n**Definition**: The mechanism by which a program receives data (input) and sends data out (output).\n\n```python\n# Input\nuser_name = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n\n# Output\nprint(f\"Hello, {user_name}!\")\n```\n\n✅ **Pros**:\n- Enables user interaction and real-world data integration.\n- Critical for debugging and logging.\n\n❌ **Cons**:\n- Unvalidated input can cause security vulnerabilities (e.g., injection attacks).\n- I/O operations can be slow compared to in-memory processing.\n\n⚠️ **Precautions**:\n- Always validate and sanitize user input.\n- Handle exceptions (e.g., file not found, invalid format).\n- Avoid blocking I/O in performance-critical applications.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Why These Basics Matter\n\nUnderstanding these core concepts allows you to:\n\n- **Think like a problem solver**, not just a code writer.\n- **Read and understand existing codebases** with confidence.\n- **Build scalable, maintainable systems** from day one.\n- **Adapt quickly** to new tools, frameworks, or languages.\n\n> 📌 *Analogy*: Learning core concepts is like learning the alphabet before writing essays. You may not need to recite them daily, but you rely on them constantly.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Common Pitfalls for Beginners\n\n| Mistake | Consequence | How to Avoid |\n|--------|-------------|--------------|\n| Ignoring error messages | Bugs go undetected | Read error logs carefully; use debugging tools |\n| Copy-pasting code without understanding | Code breaks when modified | Always trace through logic manually |\n| Not commenting code | Hard to revisit or collaborate | Comment key decisions, not obvious steps |\n| Skipping practice | Knowledge remains theoretical | Build small projects to reinforce concepts |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Exercise: Build a Mini Calculator\n\n**Objective**: Apply all four core concepts in a single program.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define functions\ndef add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\ndef subtract(a, b):\n    return a - b\n\n# Step 2: Get input\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n\n# Step 3: Control flow\noperation = input(\"Choose operation (+, -): \")\nif operation == \"+\":\n    result = add(num1, num2)\nelif operation == \"-\":\n    result = subtract(num1, num2)\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid operation\")\n    result = None\n\n# Step 4: Output\nif result is not None:\n    print(f\"Result: {result}\")\n```\n\n🎯 **Goal**: Run this program, then extend it to include multiplication and division.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Summary & Next Steps\n\nYou’ve now been introduced to the four pillars of computational thinking:\n\n1. **Variables & Data Types** → Store and manage data.\n2. **Control Flow** → Make decisions and repeat actions.\n3. **Functions & Modularity** → Organize and reuse code.\n4. **Input/Output** → Interact with users and systems.\n\n✅ **Checklist Before Moving On**:\n- [ ] Can you explain each concept in your own words?\n- [ ] Have you written and tested code using each?\n- [ ] Can you identify and fix common mistakes?\n\n➡️ **Next Chapter Preview**: *“Data Structures and Algorithms – Organizing and Processing Information Efficiently”*\n\n---\n\n## Further Reading & Resources\n\n- [Python Documentation – Built-in Types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html)\n- [Codecademy – Learn Programming Basics](https://www.codecademy.com/)\n- Book: *“Automate the Boring Stuff with Python”* – Al Sweigart (great for beginners)\n\n---\n\n> 🔚 **Remember**: Mastery begins with understanding the basics — not skipping them. Take your time. Practice deliberately. Ask questions. You’re laying the foundation for greatness.\n\nLet’s move forward — confidently, curiously, and competently.\n\n---\n\n# Chapter 4: Advanced Techniques — Deep Dive into Complex Methods\n\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nAs you progress beyond foundational concepts, the landscape of technical problem-solving becomes increasingly nuanced. This chapter explores **advanced techniques**—sophisticated, often non-intuitive methods that unlock higher performance, scalability, or precision in complex systems. These are not “hacks” but rigorously developed strategies employed by experts across domains such as machine learning, distributed systems, algorithm design, and software architecture.\n\nWe will examine each technique through:\n\n- **Conceptual foundations**\n- **Step-by-step implementation**\n- **Real-world applications**\n- **Pros and cons**\n- **Common pitfalls and precautions**\n\n---\n\n## 1. Dynamic Programming with State Compression\n\n### Concept\n\nDynamic Programming (DP) is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems. In advanced scenarios, especially with large state spaces (e.g., grid-based games, sequence alignment), **state compression** reduces memory usage by encoding states using bitmasks or other compact representations.\n\n### Example: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n\nStandard DP for TSP has time complexity O(n²·2ⁿ). With state compression via bitmasking, we can represent visited cities as bits in an integer.\n\n```python\ndef tsp_dp_bitmask(distances):\n    n = len(distances)\n    dp = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(1 << n)]\n    dp[1][0] = 0  # Start at city 0\n\n    for mask in range(1, 1 << n):\n        for u in range(n):\n            if not (mask & (1 << u)): continue\n            for v in range(n):\n                if mask & (1 << v): continue\n                new_mask = mask | (1 << v)\n                dp[new_mask][v] = min(dp[new_mask][v], dp[mask][u] + distances[u][v])\n\n    # Return min cost to return to start\n    full_mask = (1 << n) - 1\n    return min(dp[full_mask][u] + distances[u][0] for u in range(1, n))\n```\n\n### Pros:\n- Reduces space complexity from O(n·2ⁿ) to O(2ⁿ)\n- Enables solving problems previously intractable due to memory constraints\n\n### Cons:\n- Bit manipulation increases code complexity\n- Debugging becomes harder without visualization tools\n\n### Precautions:\n- Ensure correct bitmask indexing (0-based vs 1-based)\n- Avoid integer overflow in languages like C/C++ with large state spaces\n- Use memoization judiciously—some states may never be reached\n\n---\n\n## 2. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)\n\n### Concept\n\nMCTS is a heuristic search algorithm used in decision-making processes, especially in games with high branching factors (e.g., Go, Chess, Poker). It combines random sampling with tree expansion and backpropagation to estimate optimal moves.\n\n### Four Phases:\n1. **Selection**: Traverse tree using UCB1 formula until reaching unvisited node.\n2. **Expansion**: Add child nodes for unexplored actions.\n3. **Simulation**: Play out random playouts from current state.\n4. **Backpropagation**: Update statistics along path based on outcome.\n\n### Example: Tic-Tac-Toe AI\n\n```python\nclass MCTSNode:\n    def __init__(self, state, parent=None):\n        self.state = state\n        self.parent = parent\n        self.children = []\n        self.visits = 0\n        self.wins = 0\n\ndef mcts(root, iterations=1000):\n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        node = select(root)\n        if not node.is_terminal():\n            node = expand(node)\n        result = simulate(node.state)\n        backpropagate(node, result)\n    return best_child(root)\n```\n\n### Pros:\n- No need for domain-specific heuristics\n- Adapts well to imperfect information games\n- Parallelizable across simulations\n\n### Cons:\n- Computationally expensive per iteration\n- May converge slowly without good priors\n- Sensitive to exploration-exploitation tradeoff (UCB parameter tuning)\n\n### Precautions:\n- Always cap simulation depth to avoid infinite loops\n- Use progressive widening for continuous action spaces\n- Consider combining with neural networks (AlphaZero-style)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)\n\n### Concept\n\nWhile single-agent RL focuses on one agent optimizing its policy, **MARL** involves multiple agents interacting within shared environments. Agents may cooperate, compete, or do both simultaneously.\n\n### Key Challenges:\n- Non-stationarity (other agents’ policies change over time)\n- Credit assignment (who gets reward?)\n- Scalability (exponential growth in joint action space)\n\n### Example: Cooperative Navigation (Multi-Agent Particle Environment)\n\n```python\n# Using MADDPG (Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient)\nagents = [DDPGAgent(state_dim, action_dim) for _ in range(num_agents)]\n\nfor episode in range(max_episodes):\n    states = env.reset()\n    for t in range(max_steps):\n        actions = [agent.act(state) for agent, state in zip(agents, states)]\n        next_states, rewards, dones, _ = env.step(actions)\n        \n        # Centralized critic with decentralized actors\n        for i, agent in enumerate(agents):\n            agent.remember(states[i], actions[i], rewards[i], next_states[i], dones[i])\n            agent.train(agents)  # Share experiences\n        states = next_states\n```\n\n### Pros:\n- Models real-world multi-entity systems (traffic, robotics, economics)\n- Can achieve emergent cooperation/competition behaviors\n- Flexible framework adaptable to various interaction paradigms\n\n### Cons:\n- Sample inefficiency due to sparse rewards\n- Training instability from moving targets\n- Requires careful reward shaping and communication protocols\n\n### Precautions:\n- Avoid naive independent Q-learning—it fails under non-stationarity\n- Use centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE)\n- Monitor agent diversity to prevent collapse into homogeneous strategies\n\n---\n\n## 4. Differential Privacy in Machine Learning\n\n### Concept\n\nDifferential privacy (DP) provides mathematical guarantees that individual data points cannot be inferred from model outputs—even if an adversary knows all other data. Used heavily in federated learning, census data analysis, and healthcare ML.\n\n### Mechanism: Gaussian Noise Addition\n\nFor a function f(x), add calibrated noise proportional to sensitivity Δf:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef differentially_private_mean(data, epsilon=1.0, delta=1e-5):\n    n = len(data)\n    sensitivity = max(data) - min(data)  # L1 sensitivity for mean\n    sigma = sensitivity * np.sqrt(2 * np.log(1.25 / delta)) / epsilon\n    noisy_mean = np.mean(data) + np.random.normal(0, sigma)\n    return noisy_mean\n```\n\n### Pros:\n- Strong theoretical privacy guarantees\n- Compatible with most gradient-based algorithms (via DP-SGD)\n- Regulatory compliance (GDPR, HIPAA)\n\n### Cons:\n- Reduces model accuracy (trade-off between privacy and utility)\n- Computationally heavy (clipping gradients, noise injection)\n- Difficult to tune hyperparameters (ε, δ)\n\n### Precautions:\n- Never apply DP post-hoc—it must be integrated during training\n- Use libraries like `opacus` (PyTorch) or `TensorFlow Privacy` for correctness\n- Validate privacy budget exhaustion to avoid overuse\n\n---\n\n## 5. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) in Systems Design\n\n### Concept\n\nA zero-knowledge proof allows one party (prover) to convince another (verifier) that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. Critical for blockchain, identity verification, and secure computation.\n\n### Example: zk-SNARKs for Range Proofs\n\nProve that a number x is between 0 and 100 without revealing x.\n\n```solidity\n// Simplified Solidity pseudo-code using zk-SNARK library\nfunction verifyRangeProof(bytes memory proof, uint256 commitment) public view returns (bool) {\n    return zkSnark.verify(proof, [commitment, 0, 100]);\n}\n```\n\n### Pros:\n- Enables trustless verification\n- Preserves confidentiality while ensuring integrity\n- Highly scalable for blockchain applications\n\n### Cons:\n- High computational overhead for proving\n- Requires trusted setup in some variants (zk-SNARKs)\n- Complex to implement securely without specialized knowledge\n\n### Precautions:\n- Prefer zk-STARKs where possible (no trusted setup)\n- Audit circuits thoroughly—bugs can leak secrets\n- Use existing frameworks (Circom, SnarkJS, zkSync) rather than rolling your own\n\n---\n\n## 6. Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) in Scientific Computing\n\n### Concept\n\nAMR dynamically adjusts the resolution of computational grids in simulations (e.g., fluid dynamics, astrophysics) to focus resources where they’re needed most—capturing shocks, boundaries, or turbulence without wasting cycles elsewhere.\n\n### Algorithm Overview:\n\n1. Solve PDE on coarse grid.\n2. Estimate error/local features (e.g., gradients, curvature).\n3. Refine cells exceeding threshold.\n4. Interpolate solution onto finer mesh.\n5. Repeat until convergence or max level reached.\n\n### Example: Shockwave Simulation in Gas Dynamics\n\n```cpp\nvoid amr_step(Grid& grid, int max_level) {\n    for (int level = 0; level < max_level; ++level) {\n        compute_error(grid[level]);\n        refine_cells(grid[level], grid[level+1]); // Create child cells\n        interpolate_solution(grid[level], grid[level+1]);\n    }\n    solve_pde(grid[max_level]);\n}\n```\n\n### Pros:\n- Dramatically reduces computational cost compared to uniform grids\n- Maintains high fidelity near critical regions\n- Supports adaptive time-stepping too\n\n### Cons:\n- Complex bookkeeping of hierarchical meshes\n- Load balancing challenges in parallel implementations\n- Potential for oscillations if refinement criteria are poorly chosen\n\n### Precautions:\n- Use conservative refinement criteria to avoid over-refinement\n- Implement coarsening to release unnecessary fine cells\n- Test against analytical solutions or benchmark datasets\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table: Advanced Techniques Comparison\n\n| Technique                  | Best For                          | Complexity | Scalability | Privacy/Security |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------|-------------|------------------|\n| DP + State Compression    | Combinatorial optimization        | High     | Medium      | None             |\n| MCTS                      | Game AI, planning                 | Medium   | Low         | None             |\n| MARL                      | Multi-agent systems               | Very High| Medium      | Optional         |\n| Differential Privacy      | Sensitive data modeling           | High     | Low         | ★★★★☆            |\n| ZKPs                      | Blockchain, authentication        | Very High| Medium      | ★★★★★            |\n| AMR                       | Physics simulations               | High     | High        | None             |\n\n---\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nMastering these advanced techniques requires more than memorizing syntax or algorithms. It demands **deep intuition**, **systematic debugging**, and **cross-domain thinking**. Each method opens doors to previously unsolvable problems—but also introduces new failure modes.\n\n> **“Advanced does not mean infallible. It means you understand when and why to break the rules.”**\n\nUse this chapter as a toolkit—not a checklist. Combine techniques creatively, validate assumptions rigorously, and always measure impact empirically.\n\n---\n\n## Exercises\n\n1. Implement a state-compressed DP solution for the Knapsack problem with 100 items.\n2. Build a simple MCTS bot for Connect Four and compare win rates against minimax.\n3. Train two cooperating agents in a PettingZoo environment using MADDPG.\n4. Apply DP-SGD to train a CNN on MNIST and plot accuracy vs. ε.\n5.

    "llm_output_test2": "tutorial: # Full Course Tutorial\n\n# Chapter 1: Introduction to Basics — Overview of Core Concepts\n\n---\n\n## 1.1 What Are “Basics” in Technical Disciplines?\n\nIn any field — whether computer science, engineering, mathematics, or data analysis — the term **“basics”** refers to the foundational knowledge and principles that underpin all advanced work. These are not merely introductory topics; they are the *building blocks* upon which complex systems, algorithms, and theories are constructed.\n\n> **Example**: In programming, understanding variables, loops, and functions is basic — yet without them, you cannot write a meaningful program, let alone debug or optimize one.\n\nMastering basics does not mean memorizing syntax or definitions. It means developing an intuitive grasp of how components interact, why certain structures exist, and how to apply them correctly in different contexts.\n\n---\n\n## 1.2 Why Master the Basics?\n\n### Pros:\n- **Stronger Problem-Solving Skills**: You can decompose complex problems into manageable parts.\n- **Faster Learning Curve**: Advanced topics become easier to grasp when fundamentals are solid.\n- **Better Debugging & Troubleshooting**: Understanding how things *should* work helps identify where they go wrong.\n- **Adaptability**: You can learn new tools/languages more easily because you understand underlying patterns.\n\n### Cons (if neglected):\n- **Fragile Knowledge**: You may appear competent until faced with edge cases or system failures.\n- **Misapplication of Tools**: Using advanced libraries without understanding their foundations leads to inefficient or incorrect code.\n- **Long-Term Productivity Loss**: Time spent fixing preventable errors outweighs time invested in learning fundamentals.\n\n> 💡 **Analogy**: Learning to play piano without scales is like building a house without a foundation — it might look fine at first, but it won’t last.\n\n---\n\n## 1.3 Core Concepts Covered in This Chapter\n\nThis chapter introduces six essential pillars that recur across technical domains:\n\n| Concept | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Abstraction** | Hiding complexity behind simplified interfaces. |\n| **Modularity** | Breaking systems into independent, reusable components. |\n| **Data Structures** | Organizing and storing data efficiently. |\n| **Algorithms** | Step-by-step procedures for solving problems. |\n| **Control Flow** | Directing the order of operations in programs. |\n| **Error Handling & Validation** | Anticipating and managing unexpected inputs or behaviors. |\n\nEach concept will be explored through examples, analogies, and practical exercises.\n\n---\n\n## 1.4 Abstraction: The Art of Simplifying Complexity\n\n### Definition:\nAbstraction involves focusing on what something *does*, rather than *how* it does it. It allows us to manage complexity by hiding unnecessary details.\n\n### Example:\n```python\n# Without abstraction\ndef calculate_area(length, width):\n    return length * width\n\n# With abstraction\nclass Rectangle:\n    def __init__(self, length, width):\n        self.length = length\n        self.width = width\n    \n    def area(self):\n        return self.length * self.width\n\n# User doesn't need to know how area is calculated\nr = Rectangle(5, 3)\nprint(r.area())  # Output: 15\n```\n\n### Pros:\n- Reduces cognitive load.\n- Enables reuse and scalability.\n- Encourages clean interface design.\n\n### Cons:\n- Over-abstraction can obscure logic.\n- May introduce performance overhead if misused.\n\n### Precaution:\nAvoid creating abstractions too early (“premature abstraction”). Wait until you see repeated patterns before generalizing.\n\n---\n\n## 1.5 Modularity: Divide and Conquer\n\n### Definition:\nModularity is the practice of dividing a system into separate, interchangeable modules. Each module performs a specific function and interacts with others via well-defined interfaces.\n\n### Example:\nImagine a web application divided into:\n- `auth.py` – handles user login/logout\n- `database.py` – manages database connections\n- `api.py` – exposes REST endpoints\n\nEach can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.\n\n### Pros:\n- Easier testing and debugging.\n- Parallel development possible.\n- Improves maintainability and scalability.\n\n### Cons:\n- Poorly defined interfaces lead to coupling.\n- Too many small modules can increase complexity.\n\n### Precaution:\nFollow the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each module should have one reason to change.\n\n---\n\n## 1.6 Data Structures: Organizing Information Efficiently\n\n### Definition:\nA data structure is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.\n\n### Common Types:\n- **Arrays / Lists**: Ordered collections indexed by position.\n- **Dictionaries / Hash Maps**: Key-value pairs for fast lookup.\n- **Stacks / Queues**: LIFO vs FIFO access patterns.\n- **Trees / Graphs**: Hierarchical or networked relationships.\n\n### Example:\n```python\n# List: ordered, mutable\nfruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n\n# Dictionary: key-based retrieval\nprices = {\"apple\": 0.99, \"banana\": 0.59}\n\n# Stack simulation using list\nstack = []\nstack.append(\"first\")\nstack.append(\"second\")\ntop_item = stack.pop()  # Returns \"second\"\n```\n\n### Pros:\n- Optimizes memory usage and speed.\n- Matches real-world problem structures.\n\n### Cons:\n- Choosing the wrong structure leads to inefficiency.\n- Some structures require deep understanding (e.g., balanced trees).\n\n### Precaution:\nAlways consider:\n- Frequency of insertions/deletions\n- Access patterns (random vs sequential)\n- Memory constraints\n\n---\n\n## 1.7 Algorithms: Recipes for Problem Solving\n\n### Definition:\nAn algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions designed to solve a particular problem or perform a computation.\n\n### Example: Linear Search Algorithm\n```python\ndef linear_search(arr, target):\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        if arr[i] == target:\n            return i\n    return -1  # Not found\n```\n\n### Pros:\n- Provide reproducible solutions.\n- Can be analyzed for efficiency (time/space complexity).\n- Enable automation of decision-making.\n\n### Cons:\n- Poorly chosen algorithms scale poorly (e.g., O(n²) vs O(log n)).\n- Over-engineering for simple tasks wastes resources.\n\n### Precaution:\nUse Big-O notation to analyze scalability. Don’t optimize prematurely — profile first!\n\n---\n\n## 1.8 Control Flow: Directing Program Execution\n\n### Definition:\nControl flow determines the order in which statements are executed based on conditions, loops, and function calls.\n\n### Key Constructs:\n- **Conditionals**: `if`, `elif`, `else`\n- **Loops**: `for`, `while`\n- **Functions**: Reusable blocks of code\n- **Exceptions**: Handling runtime errors gracefully\n\n### Example:\n```python\nx = 10\nif x > 5:\n    print(\"x is greater than 5\")\nelif x == 5:\n    print(\"x equals 5\")\nelse:\n    print(\"x is less than 5\")\n\nfor i in range(3):\n    print(f\"Iteration {i}\")\n```\n\n### Pros:\n- Enables dynamic behavior.\n- Allows automation of repetitive tasks.\n- Facilitates error recovery.\n\n### Cons:\n- Nested conditionals/loops reduce readability.\n- Infinite loops cause crashes or hangs.\n\n### Precaution:\n- Limit nesting depth (ideally ≤ 3 levels).\n- Always include exit conditions in loops.\n- Use descriptive variable names to clarify intent.\n\n---\n\n## 1.9 Error Handling & Validation: Building Robust Systems\n\n### Definition:\nError handling anticipates and responds to exceptional situations. Validation ensures input meets expected criteria before processing.\n\n### Example:\n```python\ndef divide(a, b):\n    try:\n        result = a / b\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n        return None\n    else:\n        return result\n\n# Input validation\ndef get_age():\n    while True:\n        try:\n            age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n            if age < 0 or age > 150:\n                raise ValueError(\"Invalid age range.\")\n            return age\n        except ValueError as e:\n            print(f\"Error: {e}. Please try again.\")\n```\n\n### Pros:\n- Prevents crashes and data corruption.\n- Enhances user experience.\n- Makes systems more predictable and testable.\n\n### Cons:\n- Excessive error handling adds boilerplate.\n- Misuse can mask bugs instead of fixing them.\n\n### Precaution:\n- Fail fast: catch errors close to their source.\n- Log meaningful messages for debugging.\n- Validate inputs at boundaries (APIs, UI, file reads).\n\n---\n\n## 1.10 Putting It All Together: A Mini Project\n\nLet’s build a simple **Student Grade Tracker** using all core concepts:\n\n```python\nclass Student:\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n        self.grades = []\n\n    def add_grade(self, grade):\n        if not isinstance(grade, (int, float)) or grade < 0 or grade > 100:\n            raise ValueError(\"Grade must be between 0 and 100.\")\n        self.grades.append(grade)\n\n    def average_grade(self):\n        if len(self.grades) == 0:\n            return 0\n        return sum(self.grades) / len(self.grades)\n\n# Modularized main logic\ndef main():\n    students = {}\n    \n    while True:\n        action = input(\"Add student (a), Add grade (g), Show average (s), Quit (q): \").lower()\n        \n        if action == 'a':\n            name = input(\"Student name: \")\n            students[name] = Student(name)\n            print(f\"Added {name}.\")\n        \n        elif action == 'g':\n            name = input(\"Student name: \")\n            if name not in students:\n                print(\"Student not found.\")\n                continue\n            try:\n                grade = float(input(\"Enter grade: \"))\n                students[name].add_grade(grade)\n                print(\"Grade added.\")\n            except ValueError as e:\n                print(e)\n        \n        elif action == 's':\n            name = input(\"Student name: \")\n            if name in students:\n                avg = students[name].average_grade()\n                print(f\"{name}'s average: {avg:.2f}\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Student not found.\")\n        \n        elif action == 'q':\n            break\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n✅ Demonstrates:\n- **Abstraction**: `Student` class hides internal grade storage.\n- **Modularity**: Main loop separated from class logic.\n- **Data Structures**: List for grades, dictionary for students.\n- **Algorithms**: Average calculation.\n- **Control Flow**: Menu-driven interaction.\n- **Validation & Error Handling**: Grade bounds, existence checks.\n\n---\n\n## 1.11 Summary & Next Steps\n\nYou’ve now been introduced to the six foundational pillars of technical mastery:\n\n1. **Abstraction**\n2. **Modularity**\n3. **Data Structures**\n4. **Algorithms**\n5. **Control Flow**\n6. **Error Handling & Validation**\n\nThese are not isolated ideas — they interconnect constantly in real-world applications.

Welcome to the journey.\n\n---\n\n# Chapter 4: Advanced Techniques — Deep Dive into Complex Methods\n\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nAs you progress beyond foundational algorithms and data structures, the landscape of computer science and software engineering becomes increasingly nuanced. This chapter explores **advanced techniques**—sophisticated methodologies that solve complex problems more efficiently, elegantly, or scalably than naive approaches.

Dynamic Programming — Advanced Patterns\n\n### 1.1 State Space Reduction\n\nIn classic DP (e.g., Fibonacci, Knapsack), state space is often linear or 2D. In advanced scenarios, we reduce state space using:\n\n- **Bitmasking**: For subset problems where each element is either included or excluded.\n- **Coordinate Compression**: Reduce large integer ranges to smaller indices.\n- **State Aggregation**: Group similar states to avoid redundant computation.\n\n> **Example**: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with bitmask DP  \n> State: `dp[mask][i]` = minimum cost to visit all cities in `mask`, ending at city `i`.  \n> Time: O(n²·2ⁿ), Space: O(n·2ⁿ)\n\n```python\ndef tsp_dp(dist):\n    n = len(dist)\n    dp = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(1 << n)]\n    dp[1][0] = 0  # Start at city 0\n\n    for mask in range(1 << n):\n        for i in range(n):\n            if not (mask & (1 << i)): continue\n            for j in range(n):\n                if mask & (1 << j): continue\n                new_mask = mask | (1 << j)\n                dp[new_mask][j] = min(dp[new_mask][j], dp[mask][i] + dist[i][j])\n\n    return min(dp[(1 << n) - 1][i] + dist[i][0] for i in range(1, n))\n```\n\n### 1.2 Optimizing Transition with Convex Hull Trick / Li Chao Tree\n\nFor DP transitions of the form:  \n`dp[i] = min{ dp[j] + f(i, j) }`  \nwhere `f(i, j)` is convex or linear in `j`, we can optimize from O(n²) to O(n log n).\n\n> **Use Case**: Breaking a sequence into segments with cost function `cost(i, j) = (sum[i:j])²`.\n\n### Pros and Cons\n\n| Pros | Cons |\n|------|------|\n| Solves exponential problems in polynomial time | High memory usage |\n| Elegant and systematic | Hard to debug; state definition is critical |\n| Applicable to many optimization problems | Not intuitive for beginners |\n\n### Precautions\n- Always define base cases clearly.\n- Avoid recomputing overlapping subproblems.\n- Test edge cases: empty input, single element, all identical values.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Divide and Conquer — With Optimization\n\n### 2.1 Strassen’s Matrix Multiplication\n\nInstead of O(n³), use recursive decomposition to achieve O(n^log₂7) ≈ O(n²·⁸¹).\n\n```python\ndef strassen_multiply(A, B):\n    n = len(A)\n    if n == 1:\n        return [[A[0][0] * B[0][0]]]\n\n    # Split matrices into quadrants\n    mid = n // 2\n    A11, A12, A21, A22 = split(A, mid)\n    B11, B12, B21, B22 = split(B, mid)\n\n    # Compute 7 products recursively\n    P1 = strassen_multiply(add_matrices(A11, A22), add_matrices(B11, B22))\n    P2 = strassen_multiply(add_matrices(A21, A22), B11)\n    P3 = strassen_multiply(A11, subtract_matrices(B12, B22))\n    P4 = strassen_multiply(A22, subtract_matrices(B21, B11))\n    P5 = strassen_multiply(add_matrices(A11, A12), B22)\n    P6 = strassen_multiply(subtract_matrices(A21, A11), add_matrices(B11, B12))\n    P7 = strassen_multiply(subtract_matrices(A12, A22), add_matrices(B21, B22))\n\n    # Combine results\n    C11 = add_matrices(subtract_matrices(add_matrices(P1, P4), P5), P7)\n    C12 = add_matrices(P3, P5)\n    C21 = add_matrices(P2, P4)\n    C22 = add_matrices(subtract_matrices(add_matrices(P1, P3), P2), P6)\n\n    return combine(C11, C12, C21, C22)\n```\n\n### 2.2 Closest Pair of Points (2D)\n\nNaive O(n²) → Divide and Conquer O(n log n)\n\n**Key Insight**: After sorting by x-coordinate, split plane vertically, recurse on left/right, then check points within strip of width `2d` around median.\n\n### Pros and Cons\n\n| Pros | Cons |\n|------|------|\n| Reduces complexity dramatically | Recursive overhead |\n| Intuitive geometric reasoning | Requires careful implementation |\n| Generalizable to higher dimensions | May be overkill for small datasets |\n\n### Precautions\n- Ensure correct base case handling.\n- Avoid floating-point precision errors in geometric problems.\n- Validate that merge step doesn’t miss cross-split candidates.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Greedy Algorithms — Beyond Basics\n\n### 3.1 Matroid Theory and Greedy Optimality\n\nNot all greedy algorithms work — but when the problem satisfies **matroid properties**, greedy guarantees optimality.\n\n> **Matroid Definition**: A structure (E, I) where I ⊆ 2^E satisfies:\n> 1. Hereditary: If A ∈ I and B ⊆ A, then B ∈ I\n> 2. Exchange: If A, B ∈ I and |A| < |B|, then ∃x ∈ B\\A such that A∪{x} ∈ I\n\n> **Example**: Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal’s Algorithm) is greedy and optimal because the set of forests forms a matroid.\n\n### 3.2 Fractional Knapsack vs. 0/1 Knapsack\n\nFractional knapsack is greedy-optimal; 0/1 is NP-hard → requires DP.\n\n### Pros and Cons\n\n| Pros | Cons |\n|------|------|\n| Fast, simple, intuitive | Only works for specific problem classes |\n| Often used as heuristic for hard problems | No guarantee of global optimum without matroid property |\n| Low memory footprint | Can fail silently on non-matroid problems |\n\n### Precautions\n- Always verify whether the problem has the greedy-choice property.\n- Test counterexamples where greedy fails.\n- Consider hybrid approaches (greedy + local search).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Network Flow and Graph Matching\n\n### 4.1 Maximum Flow — Edmonds-Karp vs. Dinic’s Algorithm\n\n- **Edmonds-Karp**: BFS-based, O(V·E²)\n- **Dinic’s**: Layered graph + blocking flow, O(V²·E)\n\n> **Use Case**: Bipartite matching, image segmentation, resource allocation.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef dinic_max_flow(graph, source, sink):\n    def bfs():\n        level = [-1] * len(graph)\n        level[source] = 0\n        q = deque([source])\n        while q:\n            u = q.popleft()\n            for v, cap, rev in graph[u]:\n                if cap > 0 and level[v] == -1:\n                    level[v] = level[u] + 1\n                    q.append(v)\n        return level[sink] != -1\n\n    def dfs(u, flow):\n        if u == sink: return flow\n        for i in range(ptr[u], len(graph[u])):\n            v, cap, rev = graph[u][i]\n            if cap > 0 and level[v] == level[u] + 1:\n                pushed = dfs(v, min(flow, cap))\n                if pushed > 0:\n                    graph[u][i][1] -= pushed\n                    graph[v][rev][1] += pushed\n                    return pushed\n            ptr[u] += 1\n        return 0\n\n    max_flow = 0\n    while bfs():\n        ptr = [0] * len(graph)\n        while True:\n            pushed = dfs(source, float('inf'))\n            if pushed == 0: break\n            max_flow += pushed\n    return max_flow\n```\n\n### 4.2 Stable Marriage Problem (Gale-Shapley)\n\nGreedy matching with preference lists → guaranteed stable matching.\n\n> **Application**: Residency matching, college admissions, dating apps.\n\n### Pros and Cons\n\n| Pros | Cons |\n|------|------|\n| Guaranteed stable solution | Not necessarily optimal for all parties |\n| Efficient (O(n²)) | Sensitive to preference order |\n| Widely applicable | Doesn’t handle ties or incomplete lists well |\n\n### Precautions\n- Ensure bidirectional edges in flow networks.\n- Handle multiple edges or capacities correctly.\n- Validate that matching is truly stable (no blocking pairs).\n\n---\n\n## 5. Probabilistic Data Structures\n\n### 5.1 Bloom Filter\n\nSpace-efficient probabilistic set membership test. False positives possible, no false negatives.\n\n> **Use Case**: Web caching, spell checkers, distributed databases.\n\n```python\nimport mmh3\n\nclass BloomFilter:\n    def __init__(self, size, hash_count):\n        self.size = size\n        self.hash_count = hash_count\n        self.bit_array = [0] * size\n\n    def add(self, item):\n        for i in range(self.hash_count):\n            index = mmh3.hash(item, i) % self.size\n            self.bit_array[index] = 1\n\n    def check(self, item):\n        for i in range(self.hash_count):\n            index = mmh3.hash(item, i) % self.size\n            if self.bit_array[index] == 0:\n                return False\n        return True  # Might be false positive\n```\n\n### 5.2 Count-Min Sketch\n\nApproximate frequency counting with bounded error.\n\n> **Use Case**: Real-time analytics, heavy hitters detection.\n\n### Pros and Cons\n\n| Pros | Cons |\n|------|------|\n| Extremely space efficient | Probabilistic accuracy |\n| Fast insert/query (O(k)) | Tuning parameters affects error rate |\n| Scalable to massive datasets | Cannot delete elements |\n\n### Precautions\n- Choose appropriate hash functions (non-cryptographic, fast).\n- Size and number of hash functions must be tuned based on expected cardinality and error tolerance.\n- Never use for security-critical applications (probabilistic nature).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Memoization vs. Tabulation — When to Use Which\n\n| Aspect | Memoization (Top-Down) | Tabulation (Bottom-Up) |\n|--------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Approach | Recursive, lazy evaluation | Iterative, eager computation |\n| Memory | Stack space + cache | Only DP table |\n| Performance | May compute unused states | Computes only needed states |\n| Debugging | Easier to trace | Harder to trace recursion |\n| Use Case | Sparse state space, irregular dependencies | Dense state space, regular recurrence |\n\n> **Rule of Thumb**:\n> - Use memoization when state space is sparse or dependencies are irregular.\n> - Use tabulation when state space is dense and you want control over memory layout.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Algorithmic Complexity Analysis — Beyond Big-O\n\n### 7.1 Amortized Analysis\n\nAnalyzes average cost per operation over a sequence, even if some operations are expensive.\n\n> **Example**: Dynamic array resizing (摊还分析). Push_back is O(1) amortized despite occasional O(n) resize.\n\n### 7.2 Expected Case Analysis\n\nUsed in randomized algorithms (e.g., QuickSort with random pivot → O(n log n) expected).\n\n### 7.3 Competitive Analysis (Online Algorithms)\n\nCompares online algorithm performance against optimal offline algorithm.\n\n> **Example**: Paging algorithms (LRU vs. Belady’s optimal).\n\n### Pros and Cons\n\n| Pros | Cons |\n|------|------|\n| More realistic than worst-case | Mathematically complex |\n| Reveals hidden efficiencies | Requires assumptions about input distribution |\n| Useful for system design | Hard to teach/intuit |\n\n### Precautions\n- Don’t confuse amortized with average-case.\n- Always specify the model (adversarial, random, etc.).\n- Use empirical profiling alongside theoretical analysis.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis chapter equipped you with **advanced techniques** to tackle problems that resist brute-force or naive solutions.

    "llm_output_test3": "tutorial: # Full Course Tutorial\n\n# Chapter 1: Introduction to Basics — Overview of Core Concepts\n\n---\n\n## 1.1 What Are “Basics” in Technical Disciplines?\n\nIn any field — whether computer science, engineering, mathematics, or even creative arts — the term **“basics”** refers to the foundational knowledge and skills that serve as building blocks for advanced understanding. Mastering these fundamentals enables learners to:\n\n- Solve complex problems with confidence.\n- Adapt to new tools, languages, or frameworks.\n- Communicate effectively with peers and mentors.\n- Avoid common pitfalls rooted in misunderstanding core principles.\n\n> 💡 *Think of basics as the alphabet of a language — without them, you can’t form words, let alone sentences or stories.*\n\n---\n\n## 1.2 Core Concepts Covered in This Chapter\n\nThis chapter introduces five essential pillars that underpin most technical disciplines:\n\n1. **Variables and Data Types**\n2. **Control Flow (Conditionals & Loops)**\n3. **Functions and Modularity**\n4. **Data Structures**\n5. **Basic Algorithms**\n\nEach concept is explained with real-world analogies, code examples (in Python for clarity), pros/cons, and precautions.\n\n---\n\n## 1.3 Concept 1: Variables and Data Types\n\n### Definition\nA **variable** is a named container that holds data. A **data type** defines the kind of data a variable can store — such as numbers, text, or logical values.\n\n### Examples\n\n```python\nname = \"Alice\"           # String\nage = 30                 # Integer\nheight = 5.7             # Float\nis_student = True        # Boolean\n```\n\n### Pros & Cons\n\n| Pros | Cons |\n|------|------|\n| Makes code readable and reusable | Misusing types can cause runtime errors |\n| Allows dynamic behavior | Some languages require explicit type declaration (e.g., Java, C++) |\n| Essential for storing state | Overuse of global variables harms maintainability |\n\n### Precautions\n\n- ✅ Always choose meaningful variable names (`user_age` > `ua`)\n- ❌ Avoid reassigning variables to different types unless necessary\n- ⚠️ Be cautious with type coercion (e.g., `\"5\" + 2` may result in `\"52\"` in some languages)\n\n---\n\n## 1.4 Concept 2: Control Flow — Conditionals & Loops\n\n### Definition\n**Control flow** determines the order in which statements are executed based on conditions or repetition.\n\n#### Conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`)\n\n```python\ntemperature = 25\n\nif temperature > 30:\n    print(\"It's hot!\")\nelif temperature > 20:\n    print(\"It's pleasant.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"It's cold.\")\n```\n\n#### Loops (`for`, `while`)\n\n```python\n# For loop\nfor i in range(5):\n    print(f\"Iteration {i}\")\n\n# While loop\ncount = 0\nwhile count < 3:\n    print(f\"Count: {count}\")\n    count += 1\n```\n\n### Pros & Cons\n\n| Pros | Cons |\n|------|------|\n| Enables decision-making and automation | Infinite loops can crash programs |\n| Increases flexibility and scalability | Nested conditionals/loops reduce readability |\n| Critical for handling edge cases | Poorly structured logic leads to bugs |\n\n### Precautions\n\n- ✅ Use early returns or guard clauses to simplify nested `if` statements\n- ❌ Never leave a `while` loop without a clear exit condition\n- ⚠️ Avoid deep nesting — refactor into functions if needed\n\n---\n\n## 1.5 Concept 3: Functions and Modularity\n\n### Definition\nA **function** is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task. **Modularity** means breaking down large programs into smaller, manageable components.\n\n### Example\n\n```python\ndef calculate_area(length, width):\n    \"\"\"Returns area of rectangle.\"\"\"\n    return length * width\n\narea = calculate_area(5, 3)\nprint(area)  # Output: 15\n```\n\n### Pros & Cons\n\n| Pros | Cons |\n|------|------|\n| Promotes code reuse and DRY principle | Over-modularization can make debugging harder |\n| Improves readability and testing | Poor function naming hides intent |\n| Encapsulates complexity | Side effects (mutating globals) break predictability |\n\n### Precautions\n\n- ✅ Name functions clearly (`get_user_data()` > `func1()`)\n- ❌ Avoid functions longer than 20–30 lines\n- ⚠️ Minimize side effects; prefer pure functions when possible\n\n---\n\n## 1.6 Concept 4: Data Structures\n\n### Definition\n**Data structures** organize and store data efficiently. Common ones include arrays, lists, dictionaries, stacks, queues, and trees.\n\n### Examples (Python)\n\n```python\n# List (ordered, mutable)\nfruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n\n# Dictionary (key-value pairs)\nperson = {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 28}\n\n# Set (unique elements)\ncolors = {\"red\", \"blue\", \"green\"}\n```\n\n### Pros & Cons\n\n| Structure | Pros | Cons |\n|-----------|------|------|\n| **List/Array** | Fast indexing, simple syntax | Slow insertion/deletion at start/middle |\n| **Dictionary/Hash Map** | O(1) lookup by key | Unordered (in older Python versions), memory overhead |\n| **Set** | Unique elements, fast membership test | No ordering, no duplicates allowed |\n| **Stack/Queue** | LIFO/FIFO behavior useful in algorithms | Requires manual management in basic languages |\n\n### Precautions\n\n- ✅ Choose the right structure for your use case (e.g., dict for lookups, list for ordered items)\n- ❌ Don’t use lists for frequent insertions/deletions — consider deque or linked lists\n- ⚠️ Beware of mutability — modifying shared structures can lead to unexpected behavior\n\n---\n\n## 1.7 Concept 5: Basic Algorithms\n\n### Definition\nAn **algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem. Even simple tasks like searching or sorting rely on algorithms.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Linear Search\n```python\ndef linear_search(arr, target):\n    for i, val in enumerate(arr):\n        if val == target:\n            return i\n    return -1\n\nnumbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]\nprint(linear_search(numbers, 30))  # Output: 2\n```\n\n#### Bubble Sort\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(0, n-i-1):\n            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n    return arr\n\nunsorted = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22]\nprint(bubble_sort(unsorted))  # Output: [12, 22, 25, 34, 64]\n```\n\n### Pros & Cons\n\n| Algorithm | Pros | Cons |\n|-----------|------|------|\n| **Linear Search** | Simple, works on unsorted data | O(n) time — inefficient for large datasets |\n| **Bubble Sort** | Easy to understand and implement | O(n²) — too slow for practical use beyond small sets |\n| **Binary Search** | O(log n) — very efficient | Only works on sorted data |\n\n### Precautions\n\n- ✅ Understand Big-O notation to evaluate efficiency\n- ❌ Don’t reinvent the wheel — use built-in methods where appropriate (`sorted()`, `bisect`)\n- ⚠️ Always validate input before running algorithms (empty arrays, nulls, etc.)\n\n---\n\n## 1.8 Why These Basics Matter\n\nThese five concepts form the DNA of computational thinking:\n\n- They appear in every programming language.\n- They’re tested in technical interviews.\n- They empower you to build anything from web apps to AI models.\n\n> 🎯 *You don’t need to master all at once — but you must understand each deeply enough to recognize when and how to apply it.*\n\n---\n\n## 1.9 Practical Exercise: Build a Mini Calculator\n\n**Goal**: Write a program that asks the user for two numbers and an operation (+, -, *, /), then displays the result.\n\n```python\ndef calculator():\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n    op = input(\"Enter operator (+, -, *, /): \")\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n\n    if op == \"+\":\n        result = num1 + num2\n    elif op == \"-\":\n        result = num1 - num2\n    elif op == \"*\":\n        result = num1 * num2\n    elif op == \"/\":\n        if num2 != 0:\n            result = num1 / num2\n        else:\n            print(\"Error: Division by zero!\")\n            return\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid operator\")\n        return\n\n    print(f\"Result: {result}\")\n\ncalculator()\n```\n\n✅ Try extending this with error handling, more operations, or a GUI later!\n\n---\n\n## 1.10 Summary Checklist\n\nBy the end of this chapter, you should be able to:\n\n- [ ] Declare and use variables with correct data types.\n- [ ] Write conditional statements and loops.\n- [ ] Define and call functions with parameters and return values.\n- [ ] Select appropriate data structures for given problems.\n- [ ] Implement and trace basic algorithms like search and sort.\n- [ ] Apply best practices and avoid common pitfalls.\n\n---\n\n## 1.11 Next Steps\n\nNow that you’ve laid the foundation, move to:\n\n➡️ **Chapter 2: Problem Solving Strategies** — Learn how to break down complex problems using pseudocode, flowcharts, and decomposition.\n\n➡️ **Chapter 3: Debugging & Testing Fundamentals** — Turn mistakes into learning opportunities.\n\n---\n\n## 📘 Further Reading\n\n- *“Clean Code” by Robert C.

Dynamic Programming with State-Space Optimization\n\n### Concept Overview\n\nDynamic Programming (DP) is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems and storing intermediate results to avoid redundant computation. Advanced DP involves optimizing state representation, reducing dimensionality, or leveraging monotonicity properties.\n\n### Example: Optimal Binary Search Tree (OBST)\n\nGiven keys `K = [10, 20, 30]` with frequencies `[34, 8, 50]`, find the BST with minimal expected search cost.\n\n```python\ndef optimal_bst(keys, freq):\n    n = len(keys)\n    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n    sum_freq = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n\n    # Precompute cumulative frequencies\n    for i in range(n):\n        sum_freq[i][i] = freq[i]\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            sum_freq[i][j] = sum_freq[i][j-1] + freq[j]\n\n    # Fill DP table\n    for length in range(1, n+1):\n        for i in range(n - length + 1):\n            j = i + length - 1\n            if i == j:\n                dp[i][j] = freq[i]\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = float('inf')\n                for r in range(i, j+1):\n                    left_cost = dp[i][r-1] if r > i else 0\n                    right_cost = dp[r+1][j] if r < j else 0\n                    total_cost = left_cost + right_cost + sum_freq[i][j]\n                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], total_cost)\n\n    return dp[0][n-1]\n```\n\n### Pros:\n- Guarantees optimal solution for many combinatorial problems.\n- Reduces time complexity from exponential to polynomial.\n\n### Cons:\n- High space complexity (O(n²) or more).\n- Not suitable for problems without overlapping subproblems.\n\n### Precautions:\n- Always validate base cases.\n- Avoid recomputing sums; precompute where possible.\n- Use iterative over recursive DP to prevent stack overflow.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Advanced Concurrency: Lock-Free and Wait-Free Algorithms\n\n### Concept Overview\n\nIn highly concurrent environments, traditional locking can lead to deadlocks, priority inversion, and poor scalability. Lock-free and wait-free algorithms guarantee progress under contention using atomic operations (e.g., CAS — Compare-and-Swap).\n\n### Example: Lock-Free Stack\n\n```c\ntypedef struct node {\n    int data;\n    struct node* next;\n} node_t;\n\ntypedef struct {\n    node_t* head;\n} lockfree_stack_t;\n\nvoid push(lockfree_stack_t* stack, int data) {\n    node_t* new_node = malloc(sizeof(node_t));\n    new_node->data = data;\n\n    do {\n        new_node->next = stack->head;\n    } while (!__sync_bool_compare_and_swap(&stack->head, new_node->next, new_node));\n}\n\nint pop(lockfree_stack_t* stack) {\n    node_t* old_head;\n    do {\n        old_head = stack->head;\n        if (old_head == NULL) return -1; // empty\n    } while (!__sync_bool_compare_and_swap(&stack->head, old_head, old_head->next));\n\n    int data = old_head->data;\n    free(old_head);\n    return data;\n}\n```\n\n### Pros:\n- Scalable under high contention.\n- No risk of deadlock or livelock (if implemented correctly).\n- Better performance on multi-core systems.\n\n### Cons:\n- Extremely difficult to debug and verify correctness.\n- Memory reclamation is non-trivial (requires hazard pointers or RCU).\n- May suffer from ABA problem.\n\n### Precautions:\n- Always use atomic operations provided by your platform/compiler.\n- Test under extreme load and race conditions.\n- Prefer libraries like `liblfds` or `Boost.Lockfree` unless building from scratch.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Probabilistic Data Structures: Bloom Filters & HyperLogLog\n\n### Concept Overview\n\nWhen exact answers are not required, probabilistic data structures offer massive space savings at the cost of bounded error rates.\n\n#### Bloom Filter (Membership Testing)\n\n```python\nimport mmh3\nfrom bitarray import bitarray\n\nclass BloomFilter:\n    def __init__(self, size, hash_count):\n        self.size = size\n        self.hash_count = hash_count\n        self.bit_array = bitarray(size)\n        self.bit_array.setall(0)\n\n    def add(self, item):\n        for i in range(self.hash_count):\n            index = mmh3.hash(item, i) % self.size\n            self.bit_array[index] = True\n\n    def check(self, item):\n        for i in range(self.hash_count):\n            index = mmh3.hash(item, i) % self.size\n            if not self.bit_array[index]:\n                return False\n        return True  # May be false positive\n```\n\n#### HyperLogLog (Cardinality Estimation)\n\nUsed to estimate the number of distinct elements in a stream with O(log log n) space.\n\n```python\n# Simplified sketch — actual implementations use harmonic mean and bias correction\nclass HyperLogLog:\n    def __init__(self, b=14):  # 2^b registers\n        self.b = b\n        self.m = 1 << b\n        self.registers = [0] * self.m\n\n    def add(self, item):\n        x = mmh3.hash(str(item))\n        j = x & ((1 << self.b) - 1)  # first b bits\n        w = x >> self.b             # remaining bits\n        rho = 1\n        while w & 1 == 0 and rho < 64:\n            rho += 1\n            w >>= 1\n        self.registers[j] = max(self.registers[j], rho)\n\n    def count(self):\n        alpha_m = 0.7213 / (1 + 1.079 / self.m)\n        E = alpha_m * self.m**2 / sum(2**(-reg) for reg in self.registers)\n        if E <= 2.5 * self.m:\n            V = sum(1 for r in self.registers if r == 0)\n            if V > 0:\n                E = self.m * math.log(self.m / V)\n        elif E > 2**32 / 30:\n            E = -2**32 * math.log(1 - E / 2**32)\n        return int(E)\n```\n\n### Pros:\n- Sublinear space complexity.\n- Constant-time insertions and queries.\n- Ideal for big data pipelines and streaming systems.\n\n### Cons:\n- False positives (Bloom), estimation error (HyperLogLog).\n- Not suitable for applications requiring exact counts or deletions (without variants like Cuckoo filters).\n\n### Precautions:\n- Choose appropriate parameters (m, k) based on expected cardinality and error tolerance.\n- Combine with exact counters for small datasets to reduce error.\n- Never use Bloom filters for security-critical membership checks (e.g., password blacklists).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Metaheuristics for NP-Hard Problems\n\n### Concept Overview\n\nFor problems like TSP, Knapsack, or Job Scheduling, exact solutions are computationally infeasible for large inputs. Metaheuristics provide near-optimal solutions via guided search.\n\n#### Simulated Annealing for Traveling Salesman Problem\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport math\n\ndef simulated_annealing(tsp_distances, initial_route, temp=1000, cooling_rate=0.995, iterations=10000):\n    current_route = initial_route[:]\n    current_cost = calculate_cost(current_route, tsp_distances)\n    best_route = current_route[:]\n    best_cost = current_cost\n\n    for i in range(iterations):\n        if temp < 1e-6:\n            break\n\n        # Generate neighbor by swapping two cities\n        a, b = random.sample(range(len(current_route)), 2)\n        neighbor = current_route[:]\n        neighbor[a], neighbor[b] = neighbor[b], neighbor[a]\n        neighbor_cost = calculate_cost(neighbor, tsp_distances)\n\n        # Acceptance probability\n        delta = neighbor_cost - current_cost\n        if delta < 0 or random.random() < math.exp(-delta / temp):\n            current_route = neighbor\n            current_cost = neighbor_cost\n            if current_cost < best_cost:\n                best_route = current_route[:]\n                best_cost = current_cost\n\n        temp *= cooling_rate\n\n    return best_route, best_cost\n```\n\n### Pros:\n- Can escape local optima via probabilistic acceptance.\n- Flexible and applicable to many domains.\n- Often outperforms greedy heuristics.\n\n### Cons:\n- No guarantee of optimality.\n- Parameter tuning (initial temp, cooling rate) is critical and problem-dependent.\n- Computationally expensive for very large instances.\n\n### Precautions:\n- Always run multiple trials with different seeds.\n- Monitor convergence — plot cost vs iteration.\n- Combine with local search (e.g., 2-opt) for refinement.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Compiler-Level Optimizations and Low-Level Memory Management\n\n### Concept Overview\n\nUnderstanding how compilers optimize code and how memory is laid out enables developers to write faster, cache-friendly programs.\n\n#### Example: Loop Unrolling and Cache-Aware Access\n\n```c\n// Naive\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n    result[i] = a[i] * b[i];\n}\n\n// Optimized: loop unroll + prefetch\n#pragma omp simd\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i += 4) {\n    result[i]   = a[i]   * b[i];\n    result[i+1] = a[i+1] * b[i+1];\n    result[i+2] = a[i+2] * b[i+2];\n    result[i+3] = a[i+3] * b[i+3];\n}\n```\n\n#### Memory Layout: Structure-of-Arrays vs Array-of-Structures\n\n```c\n// AoS — bad for vectorization\nstruct Point { float x, y, z; };\nPoint points[N];\n\n// SoA — better for SIMD\nfloat xs[N], ys[N], zs[N];\n```\n\n### Pros:\n- Can yield 2x–10x speedups in compute-bound code.\n- Enables efficient use of CPU caches and vector units.\n\n### Cons:\n- Platform-specific behavior.\n- May reduce code readability and portability.\n- Risk of undefined behavior if assumptions about alignment or aliasing are violated.\n\n### Precautions:\n- Use compiler flags (`-O3`, `-march=native`) judiciously.\n- Profile before and after optimization.\n- Avoid manual vectorization unless necessary — let the compiler handle it.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Model Compression in Deep Learning\n\n### Concept Overview\n\nDeploying large neural networks on edge devices requires reducing model size and inference latency without significant accuracy loss.\n\n### Techniques:\n\n#### Quantization\n\nConvert 32-bit floats to 8-bit integers:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.quantization\n\nmodel = ...  # trained model\nmodel.qconfig = torch.quantization.get_default_qconfig('fbgemm')\ntorch.quantization.prepare(model, inplace=True)\n# Calibrate with sample data\ntorch.quantization.convert(model, inplace=True)\n```\n\n#### Pruning\n\nRemove unimportant weights:\n\n```python\nfrom torch.nn.utils import prune\n\nprune.l1_unstructured(model.fc1, name='weight', amount=0.3)  # prune 30%\nprune.remove(model.fc1, 'weight')  # make permanent\n```\n\n#### Knowledge Distillation\n\nTrain a small “student” model to mimic a large “teacher”:\n\n```python\n# Student learns from teacher's softmax outputs (soft labels)\nloss = alpha * CE(student_logits, hard_labels) + (1-alpha) * KL(student_probs, teacher_probs)\n```\n\n### Pros:\n- Drastically reduces model size and inference latency.\n- Enables deployment on mobile, IoT, and embedded systems.\n- Maintains acceptable accuracy in most cases.\n\n### Cons:\n- Accuracy degradation possible if aggressive.\n- Requires retraining or fine-tuning.\n- May introduce numerical instability during quantization.\n\n### Precautions:\n- Always evaluate on validation set after compression.\n- Use mixed precision (FP16/INT8) only if hardware supports it.\n- Monitor calibration dataset representativeness for quantization.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table: Advanced Techniques Comparison\n\n| Technique                 | Best For                          | Time Complexity     | Space Complexity   | Error Rate / Risk         |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|\n| Dynamic Programming       | Optimization with substructure    | Polynomial          | Polynomial         | None (exact)               |\n| Lock-Free Algorithms      | High-concurrency systems          | O(1) per op         | Linear             | ABA, memory leaks          |\n| Bloom Filter              | Membership testing                | O(k)                | O(m)               | False positives            |\n| HyperLogLog               | Cardinality estimation            | O(1)                | O(log log n)       | Estimation error           |\n| Simulated Annealing       | NP-hard combinatorial problems    | Heuristic           | Linear             | Suboptimal solution        |\n| Compiler Optimizations    | Performance-critical code         | Varies              | Same as source     | Undefined behavior         |\n| Model Compression         | Edge deployment                   | Reduced inference   | Reduced model size | Accuracy drop              |\n\n---\n\n## Final Recommendations\n\n1. **Start Simple**: Don’t reach for advanced techniques unless simpler methods fail.\n2. **Profile First**: Measure bottlenecks before applying optimizations.\n3. **Validate Rigorously**: Especially for probabilistic or heuristic methods.\n4. **Document Assumptions**: Future maintainers need to understand why you chose a complex approach.\n5. **Combine Techniques**: E.g., use DP + memoization + pruning; or quantization + distillation.\n\n---\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- *Introduction to Algorithms* — Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein\n- *The Art of Computer Programming* — Donald Knuth\n- *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* — Martin Kleppmann\n- *Deep Learning* — Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville\n- Research Papers: “Bloom Filters” (Bloom, 1970), “HyperLogLog” (Flajolet et al., 2007), “Simulated Annealing” (Kirkpatrick et al., 1983)\n\n---\n\n> 💡 **Pro Tip**: The mark of an expert is not knowing every advanced technique—but knowing *when* and *why* to apply them.

Eine schüchterne kleine Maus traf ihn unerwartet und rannte aus Angst und Eile über die Nase des Löwen. Der Löwe erwachte aus seinem Schlaf und legte wütend seine riesige Pfote auf das kleine Tier, um es zu töten.\n\n„Verschone mich!“, flehte die arme Maus. „Bitte lass mich gehen — eines Tages werde ich dir sicherlich einen Gefallen zurückzahlen.“\n\nDer Löwe amüsierte sich darüber, dass eine Maus ihm jemals helfen könnte. Doch er war großzügig und ließ die Maus schließlich frei.\n\nEinige Tage später, während er im Wald seiner Beute nachstellte, geriet der Löwe in die Stricke eines Jägernetzes. Da er sich nicht befreien konnte, erfüllte er den Wald mit seinem wütenden Gebrüll. Die Maus erkannte die Stimme und eilte sofort zum Löwen, der im Netz kämpfte. Sie lief zu einem der großen Seile, nagte daran, bis es zerriß — und bald war der Löwe frei.\n\n„Du hast gelacht, als ich sagte, ich würde dir eines Tages einen Gefallen zurückzahlen“, sagte die Maus. „Jetzt siehst du, dass selbst eine Maus einem Löwen helfen kann.“\n\n**Keine Güte geht verloren.**\n\n---\n\n**Warum glaubt der Löwe, die Maus könne ihm niemals helfen?**  \nWeil er nicht glaubt, dass ein so kleines und schwaches Tier wie eine Maus je einem mächtigen Löwen nützlich sein könnte.\n\n**Was ist eine Fabel?**  \nEine Fabel ist eine kurze Geschichte, meist mit zwei Hauptfiguren.

In jeder Fabel steckt immer eine Moral.  \n\n**Was ist hier die Moral? Beschreibe sie mit deinen eigenen Worten.**  \nDie Moral dieser Geschichte ist: Man sollte niemanden unterschätzen, egal wie klein oder schwach er scheint.

Durch seinen Schlaf gestört, legte der Löwe wütend seine riesige Pfote auf das winzige Geschöpf, um es zu töten.\n\n„Verschone mich!“, flehte die arme Maus. „Lass mich bitte gehen, und eines Tages werde ich dir sicherlich dafür danken.“\n\nDer Löwe amüsierte sich sehr darüber, dass eine Maus ihm jemals helfen könnte.

Da er sich nicht befreien konnte, erfüllte er den Wald mit seinem wütenden Gebrüll. Die Maus erkannte die Stimme und fand schnell den Löwen, der im Netz kämpfte. Sie lief zu einem der großen Seile, die ihn festhielten, nagte daran, bis es zerriss, und bald war der Löwe frei.\n\n„Du hast gelacht, als ich sagte, ich würde dich belohnen“, sagte die Maus. „Jetzt siehst du, dass sogar eine Maus einem Löwen helfen kann.“\n\nEine Freundlichkeit wird niemals vergeudet.\n\nWarum glaubt der Löwe, die Maus könne ihn nicht belohnen?\n\nWas ist eine Fabel?\n\nEine Fabel ist eine kurze Geschichte, die normalerweise zwei Hauptfiguren enthält.

Python 的作用域与命名空间  \n\n在介绍类之前，有必要先说明 Python 的作用域规则。类定义对命名空间进行了巧妙处理，理解作用域与命名空间的工作原理是全面把握其机制的关键。顺便提一句，掌握此知识对任何高级 Python 程序员都大有裨益\n\n我们先给出一些定义：\n\n- **命名空间（namespace）** 是从名称到对象的映射。目前大多数命名空间以 Python 字典实现，但除性能外通常不可察觉，且未来可能改变。\n  \n  命名空间的示例包括：\n  - 内置名称集合（含 `abs()` 等函数及内置异常名称）；\n  - 模块中的全局名称；\n  - 函数调用中的局部名称；\n  - 从某种意义上说，对象的属性集合也构成一个命名空间。\n\n  关键点在于：不同命名空间中的名称彼此完全无关。例如，两个不同模块均可定义名为 `maximize` 的函数而互不冲突——使用者必须通过模块名前缀加以区分\n\n  顺便说明：我将“点号后跟随的名称”统称为“属性”（attribute）——例如，在表达式 `z.real` 中，`real` 即为对象 `z` 的一个属性。严格而言，对模块中名称的引用也属于属性引用：在 `modname.funcname` 中，`modname` 是模块对象，`funcname` 是其属性。此时，模块的属性与模块中定义的全局名称存在直接对应关系：它们共享同一命名空间！[1]\n\n  属性可为只读或可写。后者允许赋值操作；模块属性是可写的：例如 `modname.the_answer = 42`。可写属性也可通过 `del` 语句删除，如 `del modname.the_answer` 将移除 `modname` 对象上的 `the_answer` 属性。\n\n- **命名空间的生命周期**：命名空间在不同时间创建，具有不同寿命：\n  - 内置名称命名空间在 Python 解释器启动时创建，永不销毁；\n  - 模块的全局命名空间在模块定义被读入时创建；通常模块命名空间持续至解释器退出；\n  - 解释器顶层执行的语句（来自脚本文件或交互式输入）被视为名为 `__main__` 的模块的一部分，因此拥有自己的全局命名空间；\n  - 函数的局部命名空间在函数被调用时创建，函数返回或抛出未捕获异常时销毁（准确地说，“遗忘”更贴切地描述实际行为）；\n  - 递归调用时，每次调用均拥有独立的局部命名空间。\n\n- **作用域（scope）** 是 Python 程序中一段文本区域，其中的命名空间可被直接访问。“直接访问”指未加限定的名称引用将尝试在该命名空间中查找名称。虽然作用域在静态分析阶段确定，但实际使用是动态的。\n\n  在任意执行时刻，总有 3 或 4 层嵌套的作用域，其命名空间可被直接访问：\n  1. 最内层作用域（最先搜索）：包含局部名称；\n  2. 任何外围函数的作用域（从最近的外围作用域开始搜索）：包含非局部但非全局的名称；\n  3. 倒数第二层作用域：当前模块的全局名称；\n  4. 最外层作用域（最后搜索）：内置名称命名空间。\n\n  若某名称被声明为 `global`，则所有对该名称的引用与赋值均直接指向倒数第二层作用域（即模块的全局命名空间）。若需重新绑定位于最内层作用域之外的变量，可使用 `nonlocal` 语句；否则这些变量仅为只读（试图写入此类变量仅会在最内层作用域创建新的局部变量，而不会影响同名的外部变量）。\n\n  通常，局部作用域指向当前（文本上）函数的局部名称；在函数外部，局部作用域与全局作用域相同（即模块命名空间）。类定义还会在局部作用域中插入另一个命名空间。\n\n  必须明确：作用域由文本位置决定——无论函数从何处或以何种别名被调用，其在模块中定义的全局作用域始终是该模块的命名空间。另一方面，名称的实际查找是在运行时动态完成的；不过，语言规范正逐步向编译期静态名称解析演进，因此请勿依赖动态解析！（事实上，局部变量已实现静态确定。）\n\n  Python 的一个特殊之处在于：若未启用 `global` 或 `nonlocal` 声明，则对名称的赋值操作总是进入最内层作用域。赋值并不复制数据，仅将名称绑定到对象；删除操作同理：`del x` 仅从局部作用域所引用的命名空间中移除 `x` 的绑定。实际上，所有引入新名称的操作均使用局部作用域——特别是 `import` 语句与函数定义，会将模块名或函数名绑定至局部作用域。`global` 语句用于表明特定变量属于全局作用域并应在此处重新绑定；`nonlocal` 则表明变量属于外围作用域并应在此处重新绑定。\n\n##### 9.2.1. 作用域与命名空间示例  \n\n以下示例演示了如何引用不同作用域与命名空间，以及 `global` 与 `nonlocal` 如何影响变量绑定：\n\n```python\ndef scope_test():\n    def do_local():\n        spam = \"local spam\"\n    def do_nonlocal():\n        nonlocal spam\n        spam = \"nonlocal spam\"\n    def do_global():\n        global spam\n        spam = \"global spam\"\n    spam = \"test spam\"\n    do_local()\n    print(\"局部赋值后:\", spam)\n    do_nonlocal()\n    print(\"非局部赋值后:\", spam)\n    do_global()\n    print(\"全局赋值后:\", spam)\n\nscope_test()\nprint(\"全局作用域中:\", spam)\n```\n\n输出结果为：\n```\n局部赋值后: test spam\n非局部赋值后: nonlocal spam\n全局赋值后: nonlocal spam\n全局作用域中: global spam\n```\n\n注意：局部赋值（默认行为）并未改变 `scope_test` 中 `spam` 的绑定；非局部赋值修改了 `scope_test` 中 `spam` 的绑定；全局赋值则修改了模块级的绑定。还可观察到：全局赋值前，`spam` 并无先前绑定。\n\n---\n\n#### 9.3. 类的初探  \n\n类引入了少量新语法、三种新对象类型及若干新语义。\n\n##### 9.3.1. 类定义语法  \n\n最简单的类定义形式如下：\n\n```python\nclass ClassName:\n    <语句-1>\n    ...\n    <语句-N>\n```\n\n类定义与函数定义（`def` 语句）一样，必须执行后才生效。（理论上可将其置于 `if` 分支或函数内部。）实践中，类定义内的语句通常为函数定义，但也允许其他语句——稍后将回溯讨论。类内函数定义通常采用特殊参数列表形式（由方法调用约定决定），后文详述。\n\n当进入类定义时，会创建一个新命名空间并作为局部作用域——因此所有局部变量赋值均进入此新命名空间；特别地，函数定义会将新函数名绑定于此处。当正常退出类定义（到达末尾）时，将创建一个类对象——它本质上是对类定义所生成命名空间内容的封装；下一节将深入探讨类对象。原始局部作用域（进入类定义前的有效作用域）被恢复，且类对象被绑定至类定义头中指定的类名（如示例中的 `ClassName`）。\n\n##### 9.3.2. 类对象  \n\n类对象支持两类操作：属性引用与实例化。\n\n- **属性引用** 使用标准语法 `obj.name`。有效属性名即类对象创建时其命名空间中存在的所有名称。例如：\n\n  ```python\n  class MyClass:\n      \"\"\"一个简单示例类\"\"\"\n      i = 12345\n      def f(self):\n          return 'hello world'\n  ```\n\n  则 `MyClass.i` 与 `MyClass.f` 均为有效属性引用，分别返回整数与函数对象。类属性亦可赋值，如 `MyClass.i = 42` 可修改其值。`__doc__` 也是有效属性，返回类文档字符串：\"A simple example class\"。\n\n- **实例化** 使用函数调用语法：将类对象视作无参函数，返回该类的新实例。例如（假设上述类定义）：\n\n  ```python\n  x = MyClass()\n  ```\n\n  创建一个新实例并赋值给局部变量 `x`。实例化操作（即“调用”类对象）创建一个空对象。许多类希望创建具有特定初始状态的定制实例，因此可定义特殊方法 `__init__()`：\n\n  ```python\n  def __init__(self):\n      self.data = []\n  ```\n\n  当类定义了 `__init__()` 方法时，实例化会自动调用该方法初始化新实例。因此上例中，`x = MyClass()` 即可获得已初始化的实例。\n\n  当然，`__init__()` 可接受参数以增强灵活性；此时传给类实例化操作的参数将转发给 `__init__()`。例如：\n\n  ```python\n  >>> class Complex:\n  ...     def __init__(self, realpart, imagpart):\n  ...         self.r = realpart\n  ...         self.i = imagpart\n  ...\n  >>> x = Complex(3.0, -4.5)\n  >>> x.r, x.i\n  (3.0, -4.5)\n  ```\n\n##### 9.3.3. 实例对象  \n\n实例对象仅支持属性引用操作。有效属性名分为两类：数据属性与方法。\n\n- **数据属性** 对应 Smalltalk 中的“实例变量”或 C++ 中的“数据成员”。数据属性无需预先声明；如同局部变量，首次赋值时即自动创建。例如，若 `x` 为前述 `MyClass` 的实例，则以下代码将打印 `16`，且不留下痕迹：\n\n  ```python\n  x.counter = 1\n  while x.counter < 10:\n      x.counter = x.counter * 2\n  print(x.counter)\n  del x.counter\n  ```\n\n- **方法** 是“属于”某个对象的函数。实例对象的有效方法名取决于其所属类。按定义，类中所有函数对象属性均定义了其实例的对应方法。因此在我们的示例中，`x.f` 是有效方法引用（因 `MyClass.f` 是函数），而 `x.i` 则无效（因 `MyClass.i` 非函数）。但需注意：`x.f` 并非 `MyClass.f`——它是一个方法对象，而非函数对象。\n\n##### 9.3.4. 方法对象  \n\n通常，方法在绑定后立即调用：`x.f()`  \n若 `x = MyClass()`，则返回字符串 `'hello world'`。但并非必须立即调用：`x.f` 是一个方法对象，可保存并在后续调用。例如：\n\n```python\nxf = x.f\nwhile True:\n    print(xf())\n```\n\n将持续打印 `\"hello world\"` 直至永恒。\n\n那么，方法调用时究竟发生了什么？您可能注意到：上例中 `x.f()` 未传参数，而函数 `f()` 定义却要求一个参数。参数去哪了？显然，若函数需要参数却未提供，Python 应抛出异常——即使该参数未被实际使用……\n\n实际上，答案很明确：方法的特殊之处在于，实例对象本身会被作为第一个参数传入函数。在我们的例子中，`x.f()` 等价于 `MyClass.f(x)`。一般而言，调用含 `n` 个参数的方法，等价于调用对应函数，并将实例对象插入参数列表首位。\n\n具体机制如下：当引用实例的非数据属性时，首先搜索其类；若该名称对应一个有效的类属性（且为函数对象），则将实例对象与函数对象打包为一个方法对象；当调用该方法对象时，系统会构造一个新参数列表（将实例对象置于首位），再以该列表调用原函数对象。\n\n##### 9.3.5. 类变量与实例变量  \n\n一般而言，实例变量用于存储各实例独有的数据，类变量则用于所有实例共享的属性与方法：\n\n```python\nclass Dog:\n    kind = 'canine'          # 类变量：所有实例共享\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name     # 实例变量：各实例独有\n\n>>> d = Dog('Fido')\n>>> e = Dog('Buddy')\n>>> d.kind   # 所有狗共享\n'canine'\n>>> e.kind\n'canine'\n>>> d.name   # d 独有\n'Fido'\n>>> e.name   # e 独有\n'Buddy'\n```\n\n如“关于名称与对象的说明”所述，共享可变对象（如列表、字典）可能导致意外行为。例如，以下代码中将 `tricks` 作为类变量是错误的，因为所有 `Dog` 实例将共享同一列表：\n\n```python\nclass Dog:\n    tricks = []              # 错误：类变量误用\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n    def add_trick(self, trick):\n        self.tricks.append(trick)\n\n>>> d = Dog('Fido')\n>>> e = Dog('Buddy')\n>>> d.add_trick('roll over')\n>>> e.add_trick('play dead')\n>>> d.tricks                 # 意外共享！\n['roll over', 'play dead']\n```\n\n正确设计应使用实例变量：\n\n```python\nclass Dog:\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n        self.tricks = []     # 每只狗创建独立空列表\n    def add_trick(self, trick):\n        self.tricks.append(trick)\n\n>>> d = Dog('Fido')\n>>> e = Dog('Buddy')\n>>> d.add_trick('roll over')\n>>> e.add_trick('play dead')\n>>> d.tricks\n['roll over']\n>>> e.tricks\n['play dead']\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 9.4. 随意补充说明  \n\n若实例与类中存在同名属性，查找时优先使用实例属性：\n\n```python\n>>> class Warehouse:\n...     purpose = 'storage'\n...     region = 'west'\n...\n>>> w1 = Warehouse()\n>>> print(w1.purpose, w1.region)\nstorage west\n>>> w2 = Warehouse()\n>>> w2.region = 'east'\n>>> print(w2.purpose, w2.region)\nstorage east\n```\n\n数据属性既可被方法访问，也可被普通用户（“客户端”）访问。换言之，类无法用于实现纯粹的抽象数据类型。事实上，Python 未提供强制数据隐藏的机制——一切基于约定。（另一方面，用 C 编写的 Python 解释器本身可完全隐藏实现细节并控制对象访问；C 语言编写的扩展模块可利用此能力。）\n\n客户端应谨慎使用数据属性——随意修改可能破坏方法维护的不变量。注意：客户端可在实例对象上添加自有数据属性而不影响方法有效性，只要避免名称冲突——命名约定在此可避免大量麻烦。\n\n方法内部引用数据属性（或其他方法）无简写形式。我认为这反而提升了可读性：浏览方法时，局部变量与实例变量绝不会混淆。\n\n方法的第一个参数常命名为 `self`，但这仅为惯例；`self` 对 Python 无特殊含义。不过，不遵循此惯例会使代码对其他 Python 开发者难以阅读，且某些类浏览器工具也可能依赖此约定。\n\n任何作为类属性的函数对象均定义了该类实例的方法。函数定义不必文本上位于类内部：将函数对象赋值给类内的局部变量同样有效。例如：\n\n```python\n# 类外部定义的函数\ndef f1(self, x, y):\n    return min(x, x+y)\n\nclass C:\n    f = f1\n    def g(self):\n        return 'hello world'\n    h = g\n```\n\n此时 `f`、`g`、`h` 均为类 `C` 的属性，指向函数对象，因而都是 `C` 实例的方法——其中 `h` 与 `g` 完全等价。注意：此做法通常只会使代码更难理解。\n\n方法可通过 `self` 参数的方法属性调用其他方法：\n\n```python\nclass Bag:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.data = []\n    def add(self, x):\n        self.data.append(x)\n    def addtwice(self, x):\n        self.add(x)\n        self.add(x)\n```\n\n方法可像普通函数一样引用全局名称；其关联的全局作用域是定义该方法的模块（类本身永不会作为全局作用域）。尽管在方法中使用全局数据较少见，但全局作用域有诸多合法用途：例如，导入至全局作用域的函数与模块可被方法使用，其中定义的函数与类亦然。通常，包含该方法的类本身也定义于此全局作用域中；下一节将说明方法为何常需引用其自身类。\n\n每个值都是一个对象，因而都有一个类（亦称类型），存储为 `object.__class__`。\n\n---\n\n#### 9.5. 继承  \n\n当然，若语言特性不支持继承，便不配称为“类”。派生类定义语法如下：\n\n```python\nclass DerivedClassName(BaseClassName):\n    <语句-1>\n    ...\n    <语句-N>\n```\n\n基类名 `BaseClassName` 必须在派生类定义所在作用域的可访问命名空间中定义。除基类名外，其他任意表达式也可作为基类（例如，当基类位于另一模块时）：\n\n```python\nclass DerivedClassName(modname.BaseClassName):\n```\n\n派生类定义的执行过程与基类相同。构造类对象时，基类信息被记录下来，用于属性查找：若请求的属性在类中未找到，则继续在基类中查找；若基类本身派生自其他类，则递归应用此规则\n\n派生类的实例化无特殊之处：`DerivedClassName()` 创建该类的新实例。方法引用解析如下：首先搜索对应类属性，必要时沿基类链向下查找；若最终得到函数对象，则方法引用有效。\n\n派生类可覆盖基类方法。由于方法调用其他方法时无特殊权限，基类中调用自身另一方法的方法，可能最终调用派生类中覆盖的版本。（对 C++ 程序员：Python 中所有方法实质上都是虚函数。）\n\n派生类中的覆盖方法有时希望扩展而非简单替换基类方法。调用基类方法有简单方式：直接调用 `BaseClassName.methodname(self, arguments)`。这对客户端偶尔也有用。（注意：此方式仅在基类可通过 `BaseClassName` 在全局作用域访问时有效。）\n\nPython 提供两个内置函数支持继承：\n- `isinstance(obj, int)`：仅当 `obj.__class__` 为 `int` 或其派生类时返回 `True`；\n- `issubclass(bool, int)`：因 `bool` 是 `int` 的子类，故返回 `True`；而 `issubclass(float, int)` 为 `False`（`float` 非 `int` 子类）。\n\n##### 9.5.1. 多重继承  \n\nPython 也支持多重继承。含多个基类的类定义如下：\n\n```python\nclass DerivedClassName(Base1, Base2, Base3):\n    <语句-1>\n    ...\n    <语句-N>\n```\n\n在最简单情形下，可将父类属性查找视为深度优先、从左到右的遍历（同一类在层次结构中重叠时仅搜索一次）。即：若 `DerivedClassName` 中未找到属性，则依次在 `Base1`、`Base1` 的基类（递归）、`Base2` 等中查找。\n\n实际上机制略复杂：方法解析顺序（MRO）会动态调整以支持 `super()` 的协作调用。此机制在其他多继承语言中称为“调用下一方法”（call-next-method），比单继承语言中的 `super` 更强大。动态排序是必要的，因为所有多重继承场景均存在一个或多个菱形关系（即底层类可通过多条路径访问至少一个父类）。例如，所有类均继承自 `object`，因此任何多重继承均提供多条通向 `object` 的路径。\n\n为避免重复访问基类，动态算法以线性化方式排列搜索顺序：保留各类中指定的左右顺序、确保每个父类仅调用一次、且满足单调性（即子类化某类不会影响其父类的优先级顺序）。综合这些特性，使得设计可靠、可扩展的多重继承类成为可能。\n\n详情请参阅《Python 2.3 方法解析顺序》。\n\n---\n\n#### 9.6. 私有变量  \n\nPython 中不存在真正意义上的“私有”实例变量（即仅限对象内部访问的变量）。但存在广泛遵循的约定：以下划线开头的名称（如 `_spam`）应视为 API 的非公开部分（无论其为函数、方法或数据成员），属于实现细节，可能随时变更。\n\n鉴于类私有成员确有合理用途（例如避免与子类定义的名称冲突），Python 提供有限支持机制——名称改写（name mangling）：任何形如 `__spam`（至少两个前导下划线，最多一个尾随下划线）的标识符，将在文本层面被替换为 `_classname__spam`，其中 `classname` 为当前类名（去除前导下划线）。此改写不受标识符语法位置影响，只要其出现在类定义内部即生效。\n\n详见《私有名称改写规范》了解细节与特例。\n\n名称改写有助于子类覆盖方法时，不破坏类内部方法调用。例如：\n\n```python\nclass Mapping:\n    def __init__(self, iterable):\n        self.items_list = []\n        self.__update(iterable)       # 调用私有方法\n    def update(self, iterable):\n        for item in iterable:\n            self.items_list.append(item)\n    __update = update               # 创建私有副本\n\nclass MappingSubclass(Mapping):\n    def update(self, keys, values): # 新签名，但不破坏 __init__\n        for item in zip(keys, values):\n            self.items_list.append(item)\n```\n\n上述示例中，即使 `MappingSubclass` 引入了 `__update` 标识符，它在 `Mapping` 类中仍被改写为 `_Mapping__update`，在 `MappingSubclass` 中为 `_MappingSubclass__update`，互不干扰\n\n注意：改写规则主要为避免意外；仍可访问或修改被视为私有的变量——这在调试等特殊场景下甚至很有用。\n\n需留意：传递给 `exec()` 或 `eval()` 的代码不将调用类的类名视为当前类；这类似于 `global` 语句的效果，且同样仅限于字节编译在一起的代码。此限制同样适用于 `getattr()`、`setattr()`、`delattr()` 及直接引用 `__dict__`。\n\n---\n\n#### 9.7. 杂项  \n\n有时需要类似 Pascal 的“记录”（record）或 C 的“结构体”（struct）的数据类型，用于捆绑若干命名数据项。惯用做法是使用 `dataclasses`：\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n\n@dataclass\nclass Employee:\n    name: str\n    dept: str\n    salary: int\n\n>>> john = Employee('john', 'computer lab', 1000)\n>>> john.dept\n'computer lab'\n>>> john.salary\n1000\n```\n\n期望特定抽象数据类型的 Python 代码，常可传入模拟该类型方法的类作为替代。例如，若某函数需从文件对象格式化数据，可定义一个类，其 `read()` 与 `readline()` 方法从字符串缓冲区获取数据，并将其作为参数传入。\n\n实例方法对象自身也有属性：`m.__self__` 是拥有方法 `m()` 的实例对象，`m.__func__` 是对应的方法函数对象。\n\n---\n\n#### 9.8. 迭代器  \n\n至此，您可能已注意到：多数容器对象均可通过 `for` 语句遍历：\n\n```python\nfor element in [1, 2, 3]: print(element)\nfor element in (1, 2, 3): print(element)\nfor key in {'one':1, 'two':2}: print(key)\nfor char in \"123\": print(char)\nfor line in open(\"myfile.txt\"): print(line, end='')\n```\n\n这种访问方式清晰、简洁、便捷。迭代器贯穿并统一了整个 Python。\n\n幕后机制：`for` 语句对容器对象调用 `iter()`，返回一个迭代器对象，该对象定义了 `__next__()` 方法，逐个访问容器元素；当无更多元素时，`__next__()` 抛出 `StopIteration` 异常，通知 `for` 循环终止。\n\n您可用内置函数 `next()` 显式调用 `__next__()`，以下示例展示其工作原理：\n\n```python\n>>> s = 'abc'\n>>> it = iter(s)\n>>> it\n<str_iterator object at 0x10c90e650>\n>>> next(it)\n'a'\n>>> next(it)\n'b'\n>>> next(it)\n'c'\n>>> next(it)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nnext(it)\nStopIteration\n```\n\n理解迭代器协议机制后，为自定义类添加迭代行为变得轻而易举：定义 `__iter__()` 方法返回一个带 `__next__()` 方法的对象；若类已定义 `__next__()`，则 `__iter__()` 可直接返回 `self`：\n\n```python\nclass Reverse:\n    \"\"\"反向遍历序列的迭代器。\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, data):\n        self.data = data\n        self.index = len(data)\n    def __iter__(self):\n        return self\n    def __next__(self):\n        if self.index == 0:\n            raise StopIteration\n        self.index -= 1\n        return self.data[self.index]\n\n>>> rev = Reverse('spam')\n>>> iter(rev)\n<__main__.Reverse object at 0x00A1DB50>\n>>> for char in rev:\n...     print(char)\n...\nm\na\np\ns\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 9.9. 生成器  \n\n生成器是创建迭代器的简单而强大的工具。其编写方式类似普通函数，但在需要返回数据时使用 `yield` 语句。每次对其调用 `next()`，生成器将从上次中断处恢复执行（自动保存所有局部变量及最后执行的语句）。示例如下，展示生成器的简易创建：\n\n```python\ndef reverse(data):\n    for index in range(len(data)-1, -1, -1):\n        yield data[index]\n\n>>> for char in reverse('golf'):\n...     print(char)\n...\nf\nl\no\ng\n```\n\n任何可用生成器实现的功能，也可通过上节所述的基于类的迭代器实现。生成器的优势在于：`__iter__()` 与 `__next__()` 方法由解释器自动生成；局部变量与执行状态在调用间自动保存。这使得函数编写更简洁清晰，远胜于手动管理 `self.index` 与 `self.data` 等实例变量的方式\n\n除自动创建方法与保存状态外，生成器终止时会自动抛出 `StopIteration`。综合这些特性，创建迭代器几乎与编写普通函数同等轻松。\n\n---\n\n#### 9.10. 生成器表达式  \n\n某些简单生成器可用类似列表推导式的语法简洁表达，仅需将方括号改为圆括号。此类表达式适用于生成器被外层函数立即使用的场景。生成器表达式比完整生成器定义更紧凑、内存友好，但灵活性较低。\n\n示例：\n\n```python\n>>> sum(i*i for i in range(10))           # 平方和\n285\n>>> xvec = [10, 20, 30]\n>>> yvec = [7, 5, 3]\n>>> sum(x*y for x,y in zip(xvec, yvec))  # 点积\n260\n>>> unique_words = set(word for line in page for word in line.split())\n>>> valedictorian = max((student.gpa, student.name) for student in graduates)\n>>> data = 'golf'\n>>> list(data[i] for i in range(len(data)-1, -1, -1))\n['f', 'l', 'o', 'g']\n```\n\n---\n\n**脚注**  \n[1] 例外情况：模块对象有一个秘密的只读属性 `__dict__`，返回用于实现模块命名空间的字典；`__dict__` 是属性而非全局名称。显然，使用此属性违反了命名空间实现的抽象性，应仅限于事后调试等特殊场景。\n\n---\n\n**目录**  \n9. 类  \n 9.1. 关于名称与对象的说明  \n 9.2.

Python 3.14 a été publié le 7 octobre 2025. Pour plus de détails, consultez le journal des modifications. Voir aussi PEP 745 – Calendrier de publication de Python 3.14 Résumé – Points forts de la version¶ Python 3.14 est la dernière version stable du langage de programmation Python, avec une combinaison de modifications du langage, de l'implémentation et de la bibliothèque standard. Les changements les plus importants incluent les littéraux de chaînes de modèle, l'évaluation différée des annotations et le support des sous-interpréteurs dans la bibliothèque standard. Les modifications de la bibliothèque comprennent des capacités d'inspection significativement améliorées pour asyncio, le support de Zstandard via un nouveau module compression.zstd, la coloration syntaxique dans l'interpréteur interactif, ainsi que les dépréciations et suppressions habituelles, et des améliorations en termes d'amabilité utilisateur et de correction. Cet article ne cherche pas à fournir une spécification complète de toutes les nouvelles fonctionnalités, mais donne plutôt un aperçu pratique. Pour plus de détails, reportez-vous à la documentation, telle que la référence de la bibliothèque et la référence du langage. Pour comprendre l'implémentation complète et la justification de conception d'une modification, reportez-vous à la PEP correspondante à une nouvelle fonctionnalité ; notez toutefois que les PEP ne sont généralement pas mises à jour une fois qu'une fonctionnalité a été entièrement implémentée. Voir Migration vers Python 3.14 pour des conseils sur la mise à niveau depuis des versions antérieures de Python. Améliorations de l'interpréteur : PEP 649 et PEP 749 : Évaluation différée des annotations PEP 734 : Plusieurs interpréteurs dans la bibliothèque standard PEP 750 : Chaînes de modèle PEP 758 : Autoriser les expressions except et except* sans parenthèses PEP 765 : Flux de contrôle dans les blocs finally PEP 768 : Interface sécurisée pour débogueurs externes pour CPython Un nouveau type d'interpréteur Améliorations du mode sans verrouillage (free-threaded) Messages d'erreur améliorés Collecte des ordures incrémentielle Améliorations significatives de la bibliothèque standard : PEP 784 : Prise en charge de Zstandard dans la bibliothèque standard Capacités d'inspection asyncio Contrôle sécurisé des avertissements concurrents Coloration syntaxique dans l'interpréteur interactif par défaut, et sortie colorée dans plusieurs interfaces CLI de la bibliothèque standard Améliorations de l'API C : PEP 741 : API C de configuration Python Support de plateforme : PEP 776 : Emscripten est désormais une plateforme officiellement prise en charge, au niveau 3. Modifications de la version : PEP 779 : Python sans verrouillage est officiellement pris en charge PEP 761 : Les signatures PGP ont été abandonnées pour les versions officielles Les versions binaires Windows et macOS prennent désormais en charge le compilateur juste-à-temps expérimental Des versions binaires pour Android sont désormais fournies Nouvelles fonctionnalités¶ PEP 649 & PEP 749 : Évaluation différée des annotations¶ Les annotations des fonctions, classes et modules ne sont plus évaluées immédiatement. Au lieu de cela, les annotations sont stockées dans des fonctions spéciales d'annotation et n'évaluées que lorsque nécessaire (sauf si from __future__ import annotations est utilisé). Ce changement vise à améliorer les performances et l'utilisabilité des annotations en Python dans la plupart des cas. Le coût d'exécution pour définir des annotations est minimisé, mais il reste possible d'inspecter les annotations à l'exécution. Il n'est plus nécessaire d'encadrer les annotations entre guillemets si elles contiennent des références avant. Le nouveau module annotationlib fournit des outils pour inspecter les annotations différées. Les annotations peuvent être évaluées selon le format VALUE (qui évalue les annotations en valeurs à l'exécution, similaire au comportement des versions antérieures de Python), le format FORWARDREF (qui remplace les noms non définis par des marqueurs spéciaux), et le format STRING (qui retourne les annotations comme des chaînes). Cet exemple montre comment ces formats se comportent : >>> from annotationlib import get_annotations, Format >>> def func(arg: Undefined): ... pass >>> get_annotations(func, format=Format.VALUE) Traceback (most recent call last): ... NameError: name 'Undefined' is not defined >>> get_annotations(func, format=Format.FORWARDREF) {'arg': ForwardRef('Undefined', owner=<function func at 0x...>)} >>> get_annotations(func, format=Format.STRING) {'arg': 'Undefined'} La section de migration contient des conseils sur les modifications nécessaires en raison de ces changements, bien que dans la majorité des cas, le code continuera de fonctionner tel quel. (Contribué par Jelle Zijlstra dans PEP 749 et gh-119180 ; PEP 649 a été rédigée par Larry Hastings.) Voir aussi PEP 649Évaluation différée des annotations utilisant des descripteurs PEP 749Implémentation de PEP 649 PEP 734 : Plusieurs interpréteurs dans la bibliothèque standard¶ Le runtime CPython prend en charge l'exécution simultanée de plusieurs copies de Python dans le même processus depuis plus de 20 ans. Chacune de ces copies séparées est appelée un « interpréteur ». Toutefois, cette fonctionnalité n'était disponible que via l'API C. Cette limitation est levée dans Python 3.14, avec le nouveau module concurrent.interpreters. Il existe au moins deux raisons notables pour lesquelles l'utilisation de plusieurs interpréteurs présente des avantages significatifs : ils soutiennent un nouveau modèle de concurrence convivial (pour Python) parallélisme vrai multi-cœurs Pour certains cas d'utilisation, la concurrence dans les logiciels améliore l'efficacité et peut simplifier la conception, à un niveau élevé. En même temps, implémenter et maintenir toute concurrence autre que la plus simple est souvent un défi pour l'esprit humain. Cela s'applique particulièrement aux threads simples (par exemple, threading), où toute la mémoire est partagée entre tous les threads. Avec plusieurs interpréteurs isolés, vous pouvez tirer parti d'une classe de modèles de concurrence, comme les Processus Séquentiels Communicants (CSP) ou le modèle acteur, qui ont connu du succès dans d'autres langages de programmation, comme Smalltalk, Erlang, Haskell et Go. Considérez plusieurs interpréteurs comme des threads mais avec un partage opt-in. Concernant le parallélisme multi-cœurs : à partir de Python 3.12, les interpréteurs sont maintenant suffisamment isolés les uns des autres pour être utilisés en parallèle (voir PEP 684). Cela débloque une variété d'utilisations intensives en CPU pour Python qui étaient limitées par le GIL. L'utilisation de plusieurs interpréteurs est similaire à de nombreux égards à multiprocessing, car ils fournissent tous deux des « processus » logiques isolés pouvant s'exécuter en parallèle, sans partage par défaut. Toutefois, lors de l'utilisation de plusieurs interpréteurs, une application utilisera moins de ressources système et fonctionnera plus efficacement (car elle reste dans le même processus). Considérez plusieurs interpréteurs comme ayant l'isolement des processus avec l'efficacité des threads. Bien que cette fonctionnalité existe depuis des décennies, plusieurs interpréteurs n'ont pas été largement utilisés en raison d'une faible sensibilisation et du manque d'un module de bibliothèque standard. Par conséquent, ils présentent actuellement plusieurs limitations notables, qui devraient s'améliorer considérablement maintenant que la fonctionnalité devient mainstream. Limitations actuelles : le démarrage de chaque interpréteur n'a pas encore été optimisé chaque interpréteur utilise plus de mémoire que nécessaire (le travail continue sur un partage interne étendu entre les interpréteurs) il n'y a pas encore beaucoup d'options pour partager véritablement des objets ou d'autres données entre les interpréteurs (autre que memoryview) de nombreux modules d'extension tiers sur PyPI ne sont pas encore compatibles avec plusieurs interpréteurs (tous les modules d'extension de la bibliothèque standard sont compatibles) l'approche d'écriture d'applications utilisant plusieurs interpréteurs isolés est principalement inconnue des utilisateurs de Python, pour l'instant L'impact de ces limitations dépendra des futures améliorations de CPython, de la manière dont les interpréteurs sont utilisés et de ce que la communauté résoudra via les packages PyPI. Selon le cas d'utilisation, les limitations peuvent avoir peu d'impact, alors essayez ! De plus, les futures versions de CPython réduiront ou élimineront les surcoûts et fourniront des utilitaires moins appropriés sur PyPI. En attendant, la plupart des limitations peuvent également être résolues via des modules d'extension, ce qui signifie que les packages PyPI peuvent combler tout écart pour 3.14, et même jusqu'à 3.12 où les interpréteurs ont finalement été correctement isolés et ont cessé de partager le GIL. De même, on s'attend à ce que des bibliothèques sur PyPI émergent pour fournir des abstractions de haut niveau au-dessus des interpréteurs. Concernant les modules d'extension, des travaux sont en cours pour mettre à jour certains projets PyPI, ainsi que des outils comme Cython, pybind11, nanobind et PyO3. Les étapes pour isoler un module d'extension sont trouvées à Isoler les modules d'extension. L'isolement d'un module a beaucoup de chevauchement avec ce qui est requis pour supporter le free-threading, donc les travaux en cours dans la communauté dans ce domaine aideront à accélérer le support de plusieurs interpréteurs. Ajouté également dans 3.14 : concurrent.futures.InterpreterPoolExecutor. (Contribué par Eric Snow dans gh-134939.) Voir aussi PEP 734 PEP 750 : Littéraux de chaînes de modèle¶ Les chaînes de modèle sont un nouveau mécanisme pour le traitement personnalisé des chaînes. Elles partagent la syntaxe familière des f-strings mais, contrairement aux f-strings, retournent un objet représentant les parties statiques et interpolées de la chaîne, au lieu d'une simple str. Pour écrire une t-string, utilisez un préfixe 't' au lieu d'un 'f' : >>> variety = 'Stilton' >>> template = t'Try some {variety} cheese!' >>> type(template) <class 'string.templatelib.Template'> Les objets Template permettent d'accéder aux parties statiques et interpolées (entre accolades) d'une chaîne avant leur combinaison. Parcourez les instances Template pour accéder à leurs parties dans l'ordre : >>> list(template) ['Try some ', Interpolation('Stilton', 'variety', None, ''), ' cheese!'] Il est facile d'écrire (ou d'appeler) du code pour traiter les instances Template. Par exemple, voici une fonction qui rend les parties statiques en minuscules et les instances Interpolation en majuscules : from string.templatelib import Interpolation def lower_upper(template): \"\"\"Rendre les parties statiques en minuscules et les interpolations en majuscules.\"\"\" parts = [] for part in template: if isinstance(part, Interpolation): parts.append(str(part.value).upper()) else: parts.append(part.lower()) return ''.join(parts) name = 'Wenslydale' template = t'Mister {name}' assert lower_upper(template) == 'mister WENSLYDALE' Puisque les instances Template distinguent entre chaînes statiques et interpolations à l'exécution, elles peuvent être utiles pour nettoyer les entrées utilisateur. Écrire une fonction html() qui échappe les entrées utilisateur en HTML est un exercice laissé au lecteur ! Le code de traitement des templates peut fournir une flexibilité améliorée. Par exemple, une fonction html() plus avancée pourrait accepter un dictionnaire d'attributs HTML directement dans le template : attributes = {'src': 'limburger.jpg', 'alt': 'lovely cheese'} template = t'<img {attributes}>' assert html(template) == '<img src=\"limburger.jpg\" alt=\"lovely cheese\" />' Bien sûr, le code de traitement des templates n'a pas besoin de retourner un résultat semblable à une chaîne. Une fonction html() encore plus avancée pourrait retourner un type personnalisé représentant une structure de type DOM. Avec les t-strings en place, les développeurs peuvent écrire des systèmes qui nettoient SQL, rendent les opérations shell sécurisées, améliorent la journalisation, abordent des idées modernes en développement web (HTML, CSS, etc.), et implémentent des DSL métier légers personnalisés. (Contribué par Jim Baker, Guido van Rossum, Paul Everitt, Koudai Aono, Lysandros Nikolaou, Dave Peck, Adam Turner, Jelle Zijlstra, Bénédikt Tran et Pablo Galindo Salgado dans gh-132661.) Voir aussi PEP 750. PEP 768 : Interface sécurisée pour débogueurs externes¶ Python 3.14 introduit une interface de débogage sans surcoût qui permet aux débogueurs et profileurs de se connecter en toute sécurité à des processus Python en cours d'exécution sans les arrêter ou les redémarrer. Il s'agit d'une amélioration significative des capacités de débogage de Python, signifiant que des alternatives non sécurisées ne sont plus nécessaires. La nouvelle interface fournit des points d'exécution sûrs pour attacher du code de débogage sans modifier le chemin d'exécution normal de l'interpréteur ou ajouter un surcoût à l'exécution. Grâce à cela, les outils peuvent désormais inspecter et interagir avec des applications Python en temps réel, ce qui est une capacité cruciale pour les systèmes à haute disponibilité et les environnements de production. Pour plus de commodité, cette interface est implémentée dans la fonction sys.remote_exec(). Par exemple : import sys from tempfile import NamedTemporaryFile with NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w', suffix='.py', delete=False) as f: script_path = f.name f.write(f'import my_debugger; my_debugger.connect({os.getpid()})') # Exécuter dans le processus avec PID 1234 print('Behold! An offering:') sys.remote_exec(1234, script_path) Cette fonction permet d'envoyer du code Python à exécuter dans un processus cible au prochain point d'exécution sûr. Toutefois, les auteurs d'outils peuvent également implémenter le protocole directement comme décrit dans la PEP, qui détaille les mécanismes sous-jacents utilisés pour se connecter en toute sécurité à des processus en cours d'exécution. L'interface de débogage a été soigneusement conçue avec la sécurité à l'esprit et inclut plusieurs mécanismes pour contrôler l'accès : Une variable d'environnement PYTHON_DISABLE_REMOTE_DEBUG. Une option de ligne de commande -X disable-remote-debug. Un indicateur de configuration --without-remote-debug pour désactiver complètement la fonctionnalité au moment de la compilation. (Contribué par Pablo Galindo Salgado, Matt Wozniski et Ivona Stojanovic dans gh-131591.) Voir aussi PEP 768. Un nouveau type d'interpréteur¶ Un nouveau type d'interpréteur a été ajouté à CPython. Il utilise des appels terminaux entre de petites fonctions C qui implémentent des opcodes Python individuels, au lieu d'une grande instruction case C. Pour certains compilateurs plus récents, cet interpréteur offre de meilleures performances. Des benchmarks préliminaires suggèrent une moyenne géométrique de 3 à 5 % plus rapide sur la suite de benchmarks standard pyperformance, selon la plateforme et l'architecture. La base est Python 3.14 compilé avec Clang 19, sans ce nouvel interpréteur. Cet interpréteur fonctionne actuellement uniquement avec Clang 19 et ultérieur sur les architectures x86-64 et AArch64. Toutefois, une future version de GCC devrait également le prendre en charge. Cette fonctionnalité est facultative pour l'instant. Activer l'optimisation guidée par profil est fortement recommandé lors de l'utilisation du nouvel interpréteur, car c'est la seule configuration qui a été testée et validée pour améliorer les performances. Pour plus d'informations, voir --with-tail-call-interp. Note Ceci ne doit pas être confondu avec l'optimisation des appels terminaux des fonctions Python, qui n'est actuellement pas implémentée dans CPython. Ce nouveau type d'interpréteur est un détail d'implémentation interne de l'interpréteur CPython. Il ne change en aucun cas le comportement visible des programmes Python. Il peut améliorer leurs performances, mais ne change rien d'autre. (Contribué par Ken Jin dans gh-128563, avec des idées sur la façon de l'implémenter dans CPython par Mark Shannon, Garrett Gu, Haoran Xu et Josh Haberman.) Améliorations du mode sans verrouillage (free-threaded)¶ Le mode sans verrouillage (PEP 703) de CPython, initialement ajouté dans 3.13, a été considérablement amélioré dans Python 3.14. L'implémentation décrite dans PEP 703 a été finalisée, y compris les modifications de l'API C, et les solutions de contournement temporaires dans l'interpréteur ont été remplacées par des solutions plus permanentes. L'interpréteur adaptatif spécialisé (PEP 659) est désormais activé en mode sans verrouillage, ce qui, conjointement à de nombreuses autres optimisations, améliore grandement ses performances. La pénalité de performance sur le code mono-threadé en mode sans verrouillage est désormais d'environ 5 à 10 %, selon la plateforme et le compilateur C utilisé. À partir de Python 3.14, lors de la compilation de modules d'extension pour la version sans verrouillage de CPython sur Windows, la variable de préprocesseur Py_GIL_DISABLED doit désormais être spécifiée par le backend de construction, car elle ne sera plus déterminée automatiquement par le compilateur C. Pour un interpréteur en cours d'exécution, le paramètre utilisé au moment de la compilation peut être trouvé en utilisant sysconfig.get_config_var(). Le nouveau drapeau -X context_aware_warnings contrôle si le contrôle sécurisé des avertissements concurrents est activé. Le drapeau est activé par défaut pour la version sans verrouillage et désactivé pour la version avec GIL. Un nouveau drapeau thread_inherit_context a été ajouté, qui, s'il est activé, signifie que les threads créés avec threading.Thread commencent avec une copie du Context() de l'appelant de start(). Cela rend notamment le contexte de filtrage des avertissements établi par catch_warnings « hérité » par les threads (ou tâches asyncio) démarrés dans ce contexte. Cela affecte également d'autres modules utilisant des variables de contexte, comme le gestionnaire de contexte decimal. Ce drapeau est activé par défaut pour la version sans verrouillage et désactivé pour la version avec GIL.

Certains de ces contributeurs sont employés par Meta, qui continue de fournir des ressources d'ingénierie importantes pour soutenir ce projet.) Messages d'erreur améliorés¶ L'interpréteur fournit désormais des suggestions utiles lorsqu'il détecte des fautes de frappe dans les mots-clés Python. Lorsqu'un mot ressemblant étroitement à un mot-clé Python est rencontré, l'interpréteur suggérera le mot-clé correct dans le message d'erreur. Cette fonctionnalité aide les programmeurs à identifier et corriger rapidement les erreurs de frappe courantes. Par exemple : >>> whille True: ... pass Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\", line 1 whille True: ^^^^^^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Did you mean 'while'? Bien que la fonctionnalité se concentre sur les cas les plus courants, certaines variations d'orthographes peuvent toujours entraîner des erreurs de syntaxe régulières. (Contribué par Pablo Galindo dans gh-132449.) Les instructions elif suivant un bloc else ont désormais un message d'erreur spécifique. (Contribué par Steele Farnsworth dans gh-129902.) >>> if who == \"me\": ... print(\"It's me!\") ... else: ... print(\"It's not me!\") ... elif who is None: ... print(\"Who is it?\") File \"<stdin>\", line 5 elif who is None: ^^^^ SyntaxError: 'elif' block follows an 'else' block Si une instruction est passée aux expressions conditionnelles après else, ou si l'une des instructions pass, break ou continue est passée avant if, alors le message d'erreur met en évidence où l'expression est requise. (Contribué par Sergey Miryanov dans gh-129515.) >>> x = 1 if True else pass Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<string>\", line 1 x = 1 if True else pass ^^^^ SyntaxError: expected expression after 'else', but statement is given >>> x = continue if True else break Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<string>\", line 1 x = continue if True else break ^^^^^^^^ SyntaxError: expected expression before 'if', but statement is given Lorsque des chaînes incorrectement fermées sont détectées, le message d'erreur suggère que la chaîne pourrait être destinée à faire partie de la chaîne. (Contribué par Pablo Galindo dans gh-88535.) >>> \"The interesting object \"The important object\" is very important\" Traceback (most recent call last): SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Is this intended to be part of the string? Lorsque les chaînes ont des préfixes incompatibles, l'erreur affiche désormais quels préfixes sont incompatibles. (Contribué par Nikita Sobolev dans gh-133197.) >>> ub'abc' File \"<python-input-0>\", line 1 ub'abc' ^^ SyntaxError: 'u' and 'b' prefixes are incompatible Messages d'erreur améliorés lors de l'utilisation de as avec des cibles incompatibles dans : Importations : import ... as ... Importations depuis : from ... import ... as ... Gestionnaires d'exceptions : except ... as ... Cas de correspondance de motifs : case ... as ... (Contribué par Nikita Sobolev dans gh-123539, gh-123562 et gh-123440.) Message d'erreur amélioré lorsqu'on essaie d'ajouter une instance d'un type non hachable à un dict ou set. (Contribué par CF Bolz-Tereick et Victor Stinner dans gh-132828.) >>> s = set() >>> s.add({'pages': 12, 'grade': 'A'}) Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<python-input-1>\", line 1, in <module> s.add({'pages': 12, 'grade': 'A'}) ~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ TypeError: cannot use 'dict' as a set element (unhashable type: 'dict') >>> d = {} >>> l = [1, 2, 3] >>> d[l] = 12 Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<python-input-4>\", line 1, in <module> d[l] = 12 ~^^^ TypeError: cannot use 'list' as a dict key (unhashable type: 'list') Message d'erreur amélioré lorsqu'un objet prenant en charge le protocole de gestionnaire de contexte synchrone est entré en utilisant async with au lieu de with, et vice versa pour le protocole de gestionnaire de contexte asynchrone. (Contribué par Bénédikt Tran dans gh-128398.) PEP 784 : Prise en charge de Zstandard dans la bibliothèque standard¶ Le nouveau package compression contient les modules compression.lzma, compression.bz2, compression.gzip et compression.zlib qui ré-exportent respectivement les modules lzma, bz2, gzip et zlib. Les nouveaux noms d'importation sous compression sont les noms préférés pour importer ces modules de compression à partir de Python 3.14. Toutefois, les noms existants des modules n'ont pas été dépréciés. Toute dépréciation ou suppression des modules de compression existants n'interviendra pas avant cinq ans après la sortie de 3.14. Le nouveau module compression.zstd fournit des API de compression et décompression pour le format Zstandard via des liaisons à la bibliothèque zstd de Meta. Zstandard est un format de compression largement adopté, très efficace et rapide. En plus des API introduites dans compression.zstd, le support de la lecture et de l'écriture d'archives compressées Zstandard a été ajouté aux modules tarfile, zipfile et shutil. Voici un exemple d'utilisation du nouveau module pour compresser des données : from compression import zstd import math data = str(math.pi).encode() * 20 compressed = zstd.compress(data) ratio = len(compressed) / len(data) print(f\"Achieved compression ratio of {ratio}\") Comme on peut le voir, l'API est similaire aux API des modules lzma et bz2. (Contribué par Emma Harper Smith, Adam Turner, Gregory P. Smith, Tomas Roun, Victor Stinner et Rogdham dans gh-132983.) Voir aussi PEP 784. Fonctionnalités d'inspection asyncio¶ Ajout d'une nouvelle interface en ligne de commande pour inspecter les processus Python en cours d'exécution en utilisant des tâches asynchrones, disponible via python -m asyncio ps PID ou python -m asyncio pstree PID. La sous-commande ps inspecte l'ID de processus donné (PID) et affiche des informations sur les tâches asyncio en cours d'exécution. Elle produit un tableau de tâches : une liste plate de toutes les tâches, leurs noms, leurs piles de coroutines et quelles tâches les attendent. La sous-commande pstree récupère les mêmes informations, mais affiche plutôt un arbre visuel d'appel asynchrone, montrant les relations entre les coroutines dans un format hiérarchique. Cette commande est particulièrement utile pour déboguer des programmes asynchrones longs ou bloqués. Elle peut aider les développeurs à identifier rapidement où un programme est bloqué, quelles tâches sont en attente et comment les coroutines sont enchaînées. Par exemple, étant donné ce code : import asyncio async def play_track(track): await asyncio.sleep(5) print(f'🎵 Finished: {track}') async def play_album(name, tracks): async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg: for track in tracks: tg.create_task(play_track(track), name=track) async def main(): async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg: tg.create_task( play_album('Sundowning', ['TNDNBTG', 'Levitate']), name='Sundowning') tg.create_task( play_album('TMBTE', ['DYWTYLM', 'Aqua Regia']), name='TMBTE') if __name__ == '__main__': asyncio.run(main()) L'exécution du nouvel outil sur le processus en cours produira un tableau comme celui-ci : python -m asyncio ps 12345 tid task id task name coroutine stack awaiter chain awaiter name awaiter id --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

Python 作用域与命名空间\n\n在介绍类之前，我首先需要向您说明 Python 的作用域规则。类定义在命名空间中使用了一些巧妙的技巧，因此您需要了解作用域和命名空间的工作原理，才能完全理解其中的机制。顺便提一句，对这一主题的理解对于任何高级 Python 程序员都是有用的。\n\n让我们从一些定义开始。命名空间是从名称到对象的映射。目前大多数命名空间通过 Python 字典实现，但通常这种方式在任何方面（除了性能）都不明显，并且未来可能会改变。命名空间的例子包括：内置名称集合（包含如 abs() 这样的函数以及内置异常名称）、模块中的全局名称、以及函数调用中的局部名称。从某种意义上讲，对象的属性集合也构成一个命名空间。\n\n关于命名空间的重要一点是，不同命名空间中的名称之间绝对没有任何关系；例如，两个不同的模块都可以定义名为 maximize 的函数而不会产生混淆——模块的使用者必须使用模块名作为前缀来引用它。顺便说一下，我使用“属性”这个词来指代任何跟在点号后面的名称——例如，在表达式 z.real 中，real 是对象 z 的一个属性。严格来说，对模块中名称的引用也是属性引用：在表达式 modname.funcname 中，modname 是一个模块对象，funcname 是它的属性。在这种情况下，模块的属性与模块中定义的全局名称之间恰好存在直接映射关系：它们共享同一个命名空间！[1]\n\n属性可以是只读的或可写的。在后一种情况下，可以对属性进行赋值。模块属性是可写的：您可以写入 modname.the_answer = 42。可写属性也可以使用 del 语句删除。例如，del modname.the_answer 将从由 modname 命名的对象中移除属性 the_answer。\n\n命名空间在不同时间创建，具有不同的生命周期。包含内置名称的命名空间在 Python 解释器启动时创建，并且永远不会被删除。模块的全局命名空间在模块定义被读取时创建；通常，模块命名空间会持续到解释器退出为止。由顶层解释器调用执行的语句（无论是从脚本文件读取还是交互式输入）被视为名为 __main__ 的模块的一部分，因此它们拥有自己的全局命名空间。（实际上，内置名称也存在于一个模块中；这个模块称为 builtins。）\n\n函数的局部命名空间在函数被调用时创建，并在函数返回或引发未在函数内处理的异常时被删除。（实际上，“遗忘”可能是描述实际发生情况更好的方式。）当然，递归调用各自拥有独立的局部命名空间。\n\n作用域是 Python 程序中一个文本区域，该区域内可以直接访问某个命名空间。“直接访问”在这里意味着对未限定名称的引用会尝试在该命名空间中查找该名称。尽管作用域是静态确定的，但它们是动态使用的。在执行期间的任何时候，都有 3 或 4 个嵌套的作用域，其命名空间可以直接访问：\n\n- 最内层作用域，最先被搜索，包含局部名称；\n- 任意封闭函数的作用域，从最近的封闭作用域开始搜索，包含非局部但非全局名称；\n- 倒数第二层作用域包含当前模块的全局名称；\n- 最外层作用域（最后被搜索）包含内置名称的命名空间。\n\n如果某个名称被声明为 global，则所有对该名称的引用和赋值都直接指向倒数第二层作用域（即模块的全局命名空间）。要重新绑定位于最内层作用域之外的变量，可以使用 nonlocal 语句；如果没有声明为 nonlocal，这些变量将是只读的（试图写入此类变量将在最内层作用域中创建一个新的局部变量，而不会影响同名的外部变量）。\n\n通常，局部作用域引用的是（文本上）当前函数的局部名称。在函数之外，局部作用域引用与全局作用域相同的命名空间：即模块的命名空间。类定义会在局部作用域中再引入另一个命名空间。\n\n重要的是要认识到，作用域是由文本决定的：在模块中定义的函数的全局作用域就是该模块的命名空间，无论该函数从何处或通过何种别名被调用。另一方面，实际的名称查找是在运行时动态完成的——然而，语言规范正朝着在“编译”时进行静态名称解析的方向发展，因此请不要依赖动态名称解析！（事实上，局部变量已经由静态方式确定。）\n\nPython 的一个特殊特性是——如果没有 global 或 nonlocal 语句生效——对名称的赋值总是进入最内层作用域。赋值操作并不复制数据——它们只是将名称绑定到对象。删除操作也是如此：语句 del x 会从局部作用域所引用的命名空间中移除 x 的绑定。事实上，所有引入新名称的操作都使用局部作用域：特别是 import 语句和函数定义会在局部作用域中绑定模块或函数名称。\n\nglobal 语句可用于指示特定变量存在于全局作用域并应在那里重新绑定；nonlocal 语句则表示特定变量存在于封闭作用域中并应在该处重新绑定。\n\n9.2.1. 作用域与命名空间示例\n\n以下是一个演示如何引用不同作用域和命名空间，以及 global 和 nonlocal 如何影响变量绑定的示例：\n\n```python\ndef scope_test():\n    def do_local():\n        spam = \"local spam\"\n    def do_nonlocal():\n        nonlocal spam\n        spam = \"nonlocal spam\"\n    def do_global():\n        global spam\n        spam = \"global spam\"\n    spam = \"test spam\"\n    do_local()\n    print(\"After local assignment:\", spam)\n    do_nonlocal()\n    print(\"After nonlocal assignment:\", spam)\n    do_global()\n    print(\"After global assignment:\", spam)\n\nscope_test()\nprint(\"In global scope:\", spam)\n```\n\n示例代码的输出为：\n\n```\nAfter local assignment: test spam\nAfter nonlocal assignment: nonlocal spam\nAfter global assignment: nonlocal spam\nIn global scope: global spam\n```\n\n请注意，局部赋值（默认行为）并未改变 scope_test 对 spam 的绑定。nonlocal 赋值改变了 scope_test 对 spam 的绑定，而 global 赋值改变了模块级别的绑定。您还可以看到，在 global 赋值之前，spam 并没有先前的绑定。",
