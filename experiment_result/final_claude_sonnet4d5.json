    "llm_output_test1": "summary: # Document Summaries\n\n## Document 1\n\n**Comprehensive Summary of the Article: “Harry Potter Star Daniel Radcliffe Gains Access to £20 Million Fortune at 18”**\n\n---\n\n### **Core Event & Headline Hook**\nOn his 18th birthday, *Harry Potter* star **Daniel Radcliffe** gains legal access to a reported **£20 million ($41.1 million)** fortune — earnings accumulated from the first five *Potter* films, previously held in a trust fund. Despite this immense wealth, Radcliffe insists it won’t change who he is: “The money won’t cast a spell on me.”\n\n---\n\n### **Key Themes & Narrative Arc**\n\n#### **1. Humble Attitude Toward Wealth**\nRadcliffe rejects celebrity excess. He explicitly states he has no plans to buy luxury cars or indulge in lavish spending. Instead, he prefers affordable pleasures: books, CDs, and DVDs — items costing around £10. This positions him as grounded, self-aware, and morally conscious — deliberately distancing himself from tabloid stereotypes of spoiled child stars.\n\n> *“I don’t plan to be one of those people who… suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection.”*\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Legal & Social Transition into Adulthood**\nTurning 18 in the UK unlocks new rights: gambling in casinos, buying alcohol in pubs, and watching R-rated horror films like *Hostel: Part II*. The article humorously contrasts these mundane milestones with the global box office dominance of *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*, subtly reinforcing Radcliffe’s cultural relevance even as he enters adult life.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Private Birthday Plans Amid Public Scrutiny**\nThough details are kept secret (“under wraps”), Radcliffe confirms he’ll celebrate with “some sort of party” — but hopes the press won’t report on it. His agent declines comment, signaling a deliberate effort to maintain privacy despite intense media interest.\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Financial Background: Trust Fund Structure**\nHis earnings were safeguarded in a trust fund until age 18, reflecting responsible financial management by guardians. This context underscores that his newfound access to wealth isn’t sudden or reckless — it’s the result of long-term planning and maturity.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Conscious Management of Public Image**\nRadcliffe acknowledges the media’s tendency to predict “kid stars going off the rails,” and actively resists that narrative. He frames his restraint not as suppression, but as intentional choice: “It would be too easy for them [the media]” if he succumbed to clichés. This self-awareness enhances his credibility and likability.\n\n---\n\n#### **6. Career Beyond Harry Potter**\nWhile continuing his role in the final two *Potter* films — which continue to break box office records — Radcliffe is also building a diverse acting portfolio:\n- **TV**: *My Boy Jack* (British TV movie)\n- **Film**: *December Boys* (Australian coming-of-age drama)\n- **Stage**: Debut in Peter Shaffer’s *Equus* — a bold move signaling serious artistic ambition\n\nThis demonstrates his intent to evolve beyond the *Potter* franchise, avoiding typecasting and establishing himself as a versatile, credible actor.\n\n---\n\n#### **7. Anticipating Increased Media Pressure**\nRadcliffe anticipates being “more fair game” now that he’s legally an adult. He doesn’t resist this shift outright but acknowledges it with calm realism — framing it as part of growing up in the public eye. This mature outlook further solidifies his image as thoughtful and prepared.\n\n---\n\n### **Closing Elements & Reader Engagement**\n\n- **Interactive Link**: Readers are invited to watch an I-Reporter’s review of *Order of the Phoenix*, encouraging multimedia engagement and community participation.\n- **Copyright/Footer**: Standard Reuters disclaimer and sharing option (“E-mail to a friend”) reinforce professionalism and encourage organic distribution.\n\n---\n\n### **Structural & Journalistic Strategy**\n\nThe article follows the **inverted pyramid model**, leading with the most newsworthy fact (access to fortune at 18), then expanding into personality, context, career, and media implications. It uses **thematic subsections without formal headings**, relying on smooth transitions and direct quotes to guide readers.\n\nEach section serves a strategic purpose:\n- Humanizing Radcliffe through personal values\n- Educating readers on British legal adulthood\n- Highlighting career evolution beyond *Potter*\n- Managing media perception proactively\n\nQuotes are central — they give Radcliffe agency over his own narrative, making the story feel authentic rather than editorialized.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Tone & Message**\n\nThe tone is **playful yet respectful**, blending pop culture references (“won’t cast a spell”) with serious reflections on fame, responsibility, and identity. The article doesn’t just report facts — it **constructs Daniel Radcliffe as a symbol of responsible stardom**: someone who wields immense wealth and fame with humility, foresight, and artistic integrity.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Takeaway**\n\n> **This is not a story about money — it’s a story about maturation under pressure.**  \n> Daniel Radcliffe emerges not as a lucky child star cashing in, but as a young adult consciously shaping his identity, career, and public persona — resisting sensationalism, embracing artistry, and navigating adulthood with quiet confidence.\n\n---\n\n**In short**: At 18, Daniel Radcliffe inherits millions — but chooses to remain himself. And in doing so, he redefines what it means to grow up in the spotlight.\n\n---## Document 2\n\n**Comprehensive Summary of the Article: “Behind the Scenes: The Forgotten Floor”**\n\n---\n\n### **Overview**\n\nThis powerful, investigative piece — part of CNN’s *Behind the Scenes* series — follows correspondent **Soledad O’Brien** as she tours the **“forgotten floor”** of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention center: the **ninth floor**, a unit housing **severely mentally ill inmates** awaiting trial. Through vivid firsthand observation, historical context, and judicial insight from **Judge Steven Leifman**, the article exposes a broken system that punishes mental illness instead of treating it — and offers a compelling case for reform.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Sections & Insights**\n\n#### **1. Introduction: Setting the Stage**\n- The article opens with an **editor’s note** framing the *Behind the Scenes* series as a platform for correspondents to share personal, behind-the-scenes perspectives on major stories.\n- Soledad O’Brien is introduced as the guide through this deeply human and systemic issue — the incarceration of the mentally ill in America’s jails.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. The “Forgotten Floor”: A Tour of Human Suffering**\nO’Brien gains rare access to the 9th floor, where:\n- Inmates wear **sleeveless robes** (designed to prevent self-harm), go **barefoot**, and sleep on **hard floors** — stripped of basic comforts.\n- Cells are **small, loud, and harshly lit**, creating sensory overload.\n- One inmate shouts delusionally, “I am the son of the president,” illustrating the disconnect between reality and psychosis.\n- Judge Leifman explains these individuals often face charges like **assaulting officers or drug offenses** — crimes born not from malice, but from untreated mental illness and police encounters gone wrong.\n- **No treatment is provided** — only confinement.\n\n> 💡 *This section transforms abstract statistics into visceral, unforgettable images — forcing readers to confront the dehumanizing conditions.*\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Systemic Failure: Why This Happens**\n- **~1/3 of Miami-Dade’s jail population is mentally ill** — a staggering statistic that reveals how deeply the justice system has become a substitute for mental healthcare.\n- A vicious cycle persists: patients stabilize briefly in hospitals → return to jail → relapse → repeat.\n- Judge Leifman calls this system **“brutally unjust.”**\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Historical Roots: From Jails to Hospitals to Streets**\nThe crisis didn’t emerge overnight — it’s the result of decades of policy failure:\n- **200 years ago**: Mentally ill people were labeled “lunatics” and locked in jails without trial.\n- **Mid-20th century**: Public outcry led to their transfer to state mental hospitals — a hopeful but flawed solution.\n- **By the 1970s–80s**: Many hospitals were shut down due to abuse and neglect — releasing patients onto the streets with no support.\n- **Today**: Only **40,000–50,000** remain in state hospitals — a **90% drop** since 1955 — while community care systems never adequately filled the gap.\n\n> 📉 *Deinstitutionalization without investment in community care created today’s crisis — turning jails into the nation’s largest mental health facilities.*\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Hope in Reform: Judge Leifman’s Vision**\nJudge Leifman is not just a critic — he’s a **reformer**:\n- Since **2008**, he has spearheaded efforts to **divert mentally ill defendants** away from jails and into **treatment programs**.\n- His goal: Replace punishment with **rehabilitation and long-term care**.\n- Early results show promise — reducing recidivism and saving taxpayer money.\n\n---\n\n#### **6. The Win-Win Solution**\nReform isn’t just morally right — it’s **practically beneficial**:\n- **Patients** get real care.\n- **Families** are relieved of emotional and financial burdens.\n- **The state** saves money by breaking the costly cycle of arrest → jail → release → re-arrest.\n- **The justice system** fulfills its true purpose: delivering justice through healing, not warehousing.\n\n> ✅ *This reframes mental health reform not as a charity issue, but as a smart, sustainable, and universally advantageous policy.*\n\n---\n\n#### **7. Closing Call to Action**\nThe article ends with a simple but potent prompt:  \n> **“E-mail to a friend”**\n\nThis digital-era nudge encourages readers to **share the story**, amplifying awareness and turning passive reading into active advocacy.\n\n---\n\n### **Narrative Strategy & Impact**\n\n- **Tone**: Empathetic, investigative, urgent, yet ultimately hopeful.\n- **Structure**: Moves chronologically and thematically — from observation → diagnosis → history → solution → call to action.\n- **Rhetorical Tools**: Uses **pathos** (emotional scenes), **logos** (statistics and data), and **ethos** (Judge Leifman’s authority) to build a persuasive case.\n- **Metaphors**: “Forgotten floor” = societal neglect; “win-win” = pragmatic idealism.\n- **Goal**: To expose injustice, educate the public, and inspire systemic change.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Takeaway**\n\n> **In a system designed to punish crime, we have instead criminalized mental illness — locking away those who need help most. But through courageous leadership and thoughtful reform, we can turn jails into gateways to healing, and transform a broken system into one that truly serves justice.**\n\n---\n\n### **One-Sentence Summary**\n\n> *Through immersive storytelling and judicial insight, this article reveals how America’s jails have become de facto mental institutions — and champions a humane, cost-effective path forward that treats illness, not punishes it.*\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you’d like this adapted into a presentation, classroom handout, policy brief, or social media summary!\n\n---",

Rather than leading with official statements or statistics, the article centers on **human experience** — using vivid, first-person narratives to convey the terror, confusion, and resilience that unfolded in real time.\n\nThe structure is narrative-driven, moving chronologically from the moment of collapse through survival, rescue, and emotional reflection — interspersed with multimedia prompts to deepen immersion. The tone balances urgency with empathy, making it both informative and deeply moving.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Sections & Highlights**\n\n#### **I. The Collapse — A Sudden, Devastating Event**\n\n- The bridge collapsed without warning, sending vehicles plummeting up to 30–35 feet into the river below.\n- Survivors describe hearing a **rumble**, seeing **dust clouds**, and experiencing a sensation like “**out of the movies**.”\n- Chaos ensued: cars were submerged, some on fire; people screamed, injured, trapped.\n\n> *“I thought I was dead,”* said Gary Babineau, one of the central figures in the story.\n\n---\n\n#### **II.

It doesn’t just tell us *what happened* — it lets us feel *how it felt*: the terror of falling, the adrenaline of rescuing strangers, the disbelief of surviving against all odds.\n\nThrough its layered structure — combining personal testimony, professional response, and interactive media — the piece becomes more than a news item. It is a **narrative mosaic of courage, chaos, and community**, reflecting the best of human instinct under pressure.\n\nIn the face of tragedy, the article reminds us: even when infrastructure fails, humanity can rise — sometimes literally, sometimes metaphorically — to meet the moment.\n\n---\n\n✅ **Final Takeaway**:  \n*A powerful example of modern journalism that prioritizes human experience over headline stats — turning catastrophe into connection, fear into empathy, and survival into inspiration.*\n\n---## Document 2\n\n**Comprehensive Summary of the Article:**\n\nOn a Saturday at Camp David, President George W. Bush underwent a routine colonoscopy during which doctors removed five small polyps — all less than one centimeter in diameter — from his colon. According to White House spokesman Scott Stanzel, “none appeared worrisome,” and tissue samples were sent to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for microscopic examination, with results expected within two to three days.\n\nTo ensure constitutional continuity, Vice President Dick Cheney temporarily assumed presidential powers under the 25th Amendment while Bush was under monitored anesthesia care — a state of sedation that left him asleep but not fully unconscious. Bush resumed his duties at 9:21 a.m., approximately two hours after the procedure began. During this brief transition, Cheney remained at his home on Maryland’s eastern shore, engaging in casual activities like reading and playing with his dogs, with no official actions required.\n\nFollowing the procedure, President Bush was reported to be in good spirits. He spoke with First Lady Laura Bush before and after the exam, played with his dogs Barney and Miss Beazley, and resumed his schedule — including lunch, briefings with National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley and Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten, and a planned bicycle ride.\n\nThe medical team overseeing the procedure was led by Dr. Richard Tubb, the president’s personal physician, and included a multidisciplinary group from the National Naval Medical Center. This was Bush’s first colonoscopy since June 2002, when no abnormalities were found; his doctor had recommended repeating the test every five years as part of standard preventive care.\n\nBeyond reporting the event, the article serves a broader public health mission. It explains what a colonoscopy is — the most sensitive screening tool for colorectal cancer — and clarifies that polyps are benign growths that can become cancerous if left untreated. The piece highlights Tony Snow, then-White House press secretary, who was undergoing chemotherapy for colon cancer that had spread to his liver. Snow’s personal story lends emotional weight to the president’s advocacy message: “The president wants to encourage everybody to use surveillance.” A video link invites readers to watch Snow discuss both his own battle and Bush’s procedure.\n\nCiting the American Cancer Society, the article urges Americans without high-risk factors or symptoms to begin regular colorectal cancer screenings at age 50 — transforming a presidential medical update into a national public service announcement.\n\nThe article concludes with an interactive “E-mail to a friend” prompt, encouraging readers to share the story and its health message with their networks.\n\n---\n\n**Key Themes & Strategic Intent:**\n\nThis article exemplifies strategic political communication wrapped in journalistic form. Its core purposes include:\n\n- **Reassuring the public** about presidential health and governmental stability.\n- **Demonstrating institutional resilience** through smooth power transfer and adherence to protocol.\n- **Humanizing the presidency** by showcasing Bush’s lighthearted post-procedure behavior.\n- **Promoting preventive healthcare** using the president’s platform and Snow’s personal narrative to normalize colonoscopies.\n- **Building credibility** through named sources, medical institutions, timelines, and authoritative guidelines.\n\nRather than merely reporting a medical procedure, the article leverages presidential visibility to turn a private moment into a civic intervention — aiming to save lives by encouraging early cancer detection across the American public.\n\n---\n\n✅ **Final Takeaway:**  \n*This is more than a news report — it’s a carefully orchestrated blend of transparency, reassurance, education, and advocacy, using the presidency as a powerful megaphone to promote public health and reinforce democratic norms.*\n\n---## Document 3\n\n**Comprehensive Summary of the Article: “NFL Indefinitely Suspends Michael Vick Without Pay”**\n\n---\n\n### **Overview**\nThe article reports that **Michael Vick**, star quarterback for the **Atlanta Falcons**, has been **indefinitely suspended without pay** by the **National Football League (NFL)** following his admission to involvement in a **dogfighting ring**. The suspension comes as Vick prepares to plead guilty in federal court to charges related to organizing and financing illegal dogfighting operations — a crime deemed “cruel, reprehensible, and illegal” by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.\n\nThis is not merely a sports scandal but a **legal, ethical, and cultural reckoning**, involving criminal conduct, institutional accountability, animal cruelty, and the intersection of celebrity, justice, and public morality.\n\n---\n\n## **Key Events & Developments**\n\n### **1. Immediate Consequence: NFL Suspension**\n- **Action**: NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell suspends Vick indefinitely without pay.\n- **Rationale**: Goodell states Vick’s actions violated the league’s personal conduct policy and damaged its reputation.\n- **Review Clause**: Suspension will be reviewed after legal proceedings conclude — leaving open the possibility of reinstatement or permanent ban.\n\n> *This signals the NFL’s zero-tolerance stance on conduct unbecoming an athlete and its desire to protect its brand.*\n\n---\n\n### **2. Legal Admission & Plea Deal**\n- **Plea Agreement**: Vick filed a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in Virginia.\n- **Charge**: One count of conspiracy to travel in interstate commerce to sponsor a dog in an animal fighting venture.\n- **Penalties if Convicted**:\n  - Up to **5 years in prison**\n  - Up to **$250,000 fine**\n  - **Restitution** and **supervised release**\n- **Prosecutorial Leniency**: Prosecutors agree to recommend the **lowest end** of sentencing guidelines — suggesting cooperation played a role.\n\n> *Vick’s explicit admission — “I am in fact guilty” — removes any ambiguity and accelerates the legal process.*\n\n---\n\n### **3. Factual Admissions Signed by Vick**\nIn a signed statement of facts, Vick admitted to:\n\n#### **A. Organizing Dogfighting Operations**\n- Purchased pit bulls and property used for training/fighting.\n- Did **not personally bet** or receive gambling proceeds — though he funded the operation.\n\n#### **B. Gambling Structure**\n- Funds primarily provided by Vick.\n- Winnings split among co-conspirators: **Tony Taylor, Quanis Phillips, Purnell Peace**.\n\n#### **C. Killing of Dogs**\n- Agreed to kill **6–8 underperforming dogs** via **hanging and drowning**.\n- Shared responsibility with Phillips and Peace.\n\n#### **D. Co-Conspirators’ Status**\n- All three co-defendants (**Phillips, Peace, Taylor**) had already pleaded guilty and received reduced sentences.\n\n> *These admissions form the core of the case — transforming abstract allegations into documented, morally damning acts.*\n\n---\n\n### **4. Institutional Reactions**\n\n#### **NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell**\n- Strongly condemned Vick’s actions as “illegal, cruel, reprehensible.”\n- Emphasized the suspension was necessary to uphold the integrity of the league.\n\n#### **Falcons Owner Arthur Blank**\n- Called Vick’s behavior “incomprehensible and unacceptable.”\n- Supported the suspension to protect the team’s and league’s image.\n- May seek to recover **$22 million** in signing bonus money from Vick’s 2004 contract — based on contractual clauses tied to legal conduct.\n\n> *Both league and team leadership demonstrate unified moral and financial consequences — showing this is not just about punishment, but about deterrence and accountability.*\n\n---\n\n### **5. Court Proceedings & Judicial Role**\n- **Scheduled Hearing**: Vick to appear before **Judge Henry E. Hudson** on Monday to formally enter his guilty plea.\n- **Judicial Authority**: Judge must approve the plea deal — ensuring judicial oversight and preventing prosecutorial overreach.\n- **Potential State Charges**: CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin notes that **state prosecution remains possible**, using Vick’s federal admissions as evidence — highlighting the risk of dual sovereignty in U.S. law.\n\n> *This section underscores the seriousness of the legal process — reminding readers that justice is not yet complete.*\n\n---\n\n### **6. Cooperation & Restitution Obligations**\nUnder the plea agreement, Vick must:\n- **Fully cooperate** with investigators.\n- **Testify** if needed.\n- **Turn over documents** and submit to **polygraph tests**.\n- **Pay restitution** for costs associated with the care or humane euthanasia of approximately **53 seized pit bulls**.\n\n> *These obligations ensure ongoing accountability — making Vick an active participant in dismantling the criminal enterprise he helped create.*\n\n---\n\n### **7. Ethical & Emotional Dimensions**\n- **Animal Cruelty**: The graphic descriptions of dog killings evoke strong public outrage and media focus — turning a legal case into a moral cause.\n- **Public Trust**: Vick’s fall from superstar to convicted felon shocks fans and raises questions about celebrity accountability.\n- **Conflict Over Seized Dogs**: Animal rights groups advocate for euthanasia; prosecutors treat them as evidence — creating a humanitarian/legal dilemma.\n\n> *The story transcends sports — becoming a societal conversation about ethics, compassion, and justice.*\n\n---\n\n### **8. Historical Context & Timeline**\n- **Prior Suspension**: Goodell had already barred Vick from attending training camp after his indictment — showing early disciplinary action.\n- **Owner’s Caution**: Blank refused to comment on Vick’s future until reviewing the full “statement of facts” — reflecting due process and measured judgment.\n\n> *This provides continuity — showing the league’s consistent, escalating response rather than knee-jerk reaction.*\n\n---\n\n## **Supplementary Elements**\n- **Interactive Links**: Encourage deeper exploration (“Watch what led to Vick’s suspension,” “See a timeline of the case”) — enhancing engagement for digital audiences.\n- **Attribution & Sharing**: Credits contributor Mike Phelan and includes “E-mail to a friend” — standard digital journalism practices promoting transparency and virality.\n\n---\n\n## **Structural & Narrative Analysis**\n\nThe article follows a **classic inverted pyramid structure**:\n- **Top**: Most critical info — suspension, guilty plea, upcoming court date.\n- **Middle**: Supporting facts — legal details, institutional reactions, factual admissions.\n- **Bottom**: Context, implications, supplementary content.\n\nIt also employs a **narrative arc**:\n> **Crime → Confession → Punishment → Ripple Effects**\n\nEach section builds logically upon the last, balancing **legal precision** with **emotional resonance**, ensuring accessibility for both casual readers and legal professionals.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion: A Cultural & Moral Reckoning**\n\nThis is far more than a sports story. It is a **case study in institutional accountability, legal consequence, and moral failure**. Michael Vick’s suspension marks the moment when the NFL — and American society — confronted the uncomfortable reality that fame and talent do not excuse cruelty.\n\nThe article successfully:\n- **Informs** with legal accuracy,\n- **Condemns** with moral clarity,\n- **Engages** with emotional depth,\n- **Educates** with structural precision.\n\n> **Final Takeaway**:  \n> *Michael Vick’s suspension is not just about football — it’s about justice, redemption, and the cost of betrayal. The NFL, the courts, and the public are all demanding accountability — and the story continues beyond the courtroom.*  \n\n---\n\n**Optional Next Steps**:\n- Compare this case to other athlete scandals (O.J. Simpson, Barry Bonds, etc.).\n- Analyze the long-term impact on Vick’s career and public image.\n- Explore how the NFL’s conduct policy evolved post-Vick.\n\nLet me know if you’d like any of these extensions!\n\n---",

Main Results\n\n### 2.1 Proposed Algorithm (Dual Loss Strategy)\nThe algorithm uses a **dual loss strategy**:\n- **Objective**: Intensity-based loss $ f_I $ (smooth → facilitates Newton direction).\n- **Support Identification**: Amplitude-based loss $ f_A $ (superior curvature near solution → better search direction than $ f_I $).\n\n#### Two Key Steps:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Free and Fixed Variables**\n- Use amplitude-based loss to identify support:\n  $$\n  \\mathcal{S}_{k+1} = \\text{supp}\\left( \\mathcal{H}_s(\\mathbf{x}^k - \\eta \\nabla f_A(\\mathbf{x}^k)) \\right)\n  $$\n  - $ \\mathcal{H}_s $: $ s $-sparse hard-thresholding operator.\n- Free variables = $ \\mathcal{S}_{k+1} $\n- Fixed variables = complement of $ \\mathcal{S}_{k+1} $ → set to zero.\n\n**Step 2: Compute Search Direction**\n- Update free variables using (approximate) Newton direction over $ \\mathcal{S}_{k+1} $, based on intensity loss $ f_I $:\n  $$\n  \\mathbf{x}^{k+1}_{\\mathcal{S}_{k+1}} = \\mathbf{x}^k_{\\mathcal{S}_{k+1}} - \\mathbf{p}^k_{\\mathcal{S}_{k+1}}\n  $$\n  where $ \\mathbf{p}^k_{\\mathcal{S}_{k+1}} $ solves:\n  $$\n  \\mathbf{H}^k_{\\mathcal{S}_{k+1}, \\mathcal{S}_{k+1}} \\mathbf{p}^k_{\\mathcal{S}_{k+1}} = - \\mathbf{H}^k_{\\mathcal{S}_{k+1}, J_{k+1}} \\mathbf{x}^k_{J_{k+1}} + \\mathbf{g}^k_{\\mathcal{S}_{k+1}}\n  $$\n  - $ \\mathbf{g}^k_{\\mathcal{S}_{k+1}} = [\\nabla f_I(\\mathbf{x}^k)]_{\\mathcal{S}_{k+1}} $\n  - $ \\mathbf{H}^k_{\\mathcal{S}_{k+1}, \\mathcal{S}_{k+1}} = [\\nabla^2 f_I(\\mathbf{x}^k)]_{\\mathcal{S}_{k+1}, \\mathcal{S}_{k+1}} $\n  - $ J_{k+1} = \\mathcal{S}_k \\setminus \\mathcal{S}_{k+1} $, with $ |J_{k+1}| \\leq s $\n\n> 💡 **Advantage**: Exploits second-order information → faster convergence than projected gradient methods.\n\n#### Algorithm 1: Proposed Algorithm\n```plaintext\nInput: Data {a_i, y_i}, sparsity s, initial estimate x^0, stepsize η.\nfor k = 1, 2, ... do\n    Identify S_{k+1} = supp(H_s(x^k - η ∇f_A(x^k)))\n    Compute p^k_{S_{k+1}} via solving (6)\n    Update x^{k+1}: \n        x^{k+1}_{S_{k+1}} = x^k_{S_{k+1}} - p^k_{S_{k+1}},   x^{k+1}_{S_{k+1}^c} = 0\nend\nOutput: x^{k+1}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2.2 Theoretical Results\n\n**Theorem 1**: If $ m \\geq c_1 s^2 \\log n $, then with probability at least $ 1 - (c_2 k + c_3)m^{-1} $, the sequence $ \\{\\mathbf{x}^k\\}_{k \\geq 1} $ converges to ground truth $ \\mathbf{x}^\\natural $ at a **quadratic rate** after at most $ O(\\log(\\|\\mathbf{x}^\\sharp\\| / x^\\sharp_{\\min})) $ iterations, i.e.,\n$$\n\\text{dist}(\\mathbf{x}^{k+1}, \\mathbf{x}^\\natural) \\leq \\rho \\cdot \\text{dist}^2(\\mathbf{x}^k, \\mathbf{x}^\\natural), \\quad \\forall k \\geq \\bar{k},\n$$\nwhere $ \\bar{k} \\leq c_4 \\log\\left( \\|\\mathbf{x}^\\sharp\\| / x^\\sharp_{\\min} \\right) + c_5 $, and $ x^\\sharp_{\\min} $ is the smallest nonzero entry in magnitude of $ \\mathbf{x}^\\sharp $.\n\n> ✅ **Significance**:\n- Converges to ground truth (up to global sign) at quadratic rate after logarithmic iterations.\n- Requires $ m = \\Omega(s^2 \\log n) $ measurements.\n- **First algorithm** to establish quadratic convergence rate for sparse phase retrieval.\n\n---\n\n## 📊 3. Experiments\n\n### Figure 1: Relative error vs. iterations\n- Settings: $ n = 5000 $, $ s = 100 $, $ m = 3000 $\n- Subfigures:\n  - (a) Noise-free\n  - (b) Noisy\n- **Algorithms Compared**: CoPRAM, HTP, ThWF, SparTA, Proposed\n- **Result**: Proposed algorithm converges fastest in both noise-free and noisy settings.\n\n### Figure 2: Phase transition performance\n- Settings: $ n = 3000 $, sparsity levels $ s = 25 $ and $ s = 50 $\n- Y-axis: Probability of success (over 200 trials)\n- X-axis: Number of measurements $ m $\n- **Result**: Proposed algorithm achieves high success probability with fewer measurements compared to others, especially at higher sparsity ($ s = 50 $).\n\n---\n\n## 📚 References\nThe paper cites 13 key works, including foundational papers on phase retrieval (Candes et al., Chen et al.), sparse recovery (Wang & Xu), and algorithms like SPARTA, CoPRAM, HTP, and Wirtinger flow variants.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Summary & Contributions\n\nThis paper presents a **novel dual-loss algorithm** for **sparse phase retrieval** that:\n1. **Uses intensity-based loss** for smooth optimization and **amplitude-based loss** for support identification.\n2. **Adopts Newton-type updates** on free variables for faster convergence.\n3. **Proves quadratic convergence rate** under $ m = \\Omega(s^2 \\log n) $, which is **the first such guarantee** for sparse phase retrieval.\n4. **Empirically outperforms state-of-the-art** methods (CoPRAM, HTP, ThWF, SparTA) in convergence speed and sample efficiency.\n5. Achieves **lowest iteration complexity** among comparable methods.\n\n---\n\n## 🏁 Conclusion\n\nThis work bridges theory and practice in sparse phase retrieval by introducing a provably fast algorithm that leverages the complementary strengths of two loss functions and second-order optimization. Its theoretical guarantees and empirical superiority make it a significant advancement in the field.\n\n🔗 Code available: https://github.com/jxying/SparsePR\n\n---\n\n✅ **Overall Impact**: A theoretically grounded, empirically superior algorithm that sets a new benchmark for sparse phase retrieval problems.\n\n---## Image 2\n\nHere is a comprehensive summary and analysis of the provided academic poster titled **“DiffDock-Pocket: Diffusion for Pocket-Level Docking with Sidechain Flexibility”**.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 **Overall Objective**\n\nThe research introduces **DiffDock-Pocket**, an advanced machine learning method for **molecular docking** — the computational prediction of how a small molecule (ligand) binds to a protein target. The key innovations are:\n- **Pocket-specific docking**: Focusing the search on known binding sites.\n- **Sidechain flexibility**: Modeling flexible amino acid sidechains near the binding pocket.\n- **Diffusion-based modeling**: Leveraging diffusion models to generate accurate ligand poses and sidechain conformations.\n\nThis approach significantly improves accuracy and speed over existing methods, especially when using unbound (apo) protein structures.\n\n---\n\n## 🔬 **The Task: Molecular Docking**\n\nMolecular docking aims to predict the 3D orientation (pose) of a ligand bound to a protein. This is critical in **drug design**, where knowing how a drug candidate binds helps optimize its efficacy and selectivity.\n\n### Key Challenges Addressed:\n- **Large conformational space**: Both ligand and protein can change shape.\n- **Prior knowledge underutilized**: Most ML models ignore expert knowledge about binding pockets.\n- **Rigid protein assumption**: Traditional methods treat proteins as static, ignoring sidechain flexibility.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ **Methodology Overview**\n\n### 1. **Site-Specific Docking**\nInstead of searching the entire protein surface, the model starts with the ligand placed randomly *within* a predefined binding pocket. This reduces computational cost while maintaining accuracy.\n\n> *“We discard all amino acids that are too far away from the pocket.”*\n\nThis step leverages domain knowledge to constrain the search space effectively.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Learning Poses with Diffusion**\n\nThe core innovation uses **diffusion models** — a type of generative model — to learn how to “denoise” random noise into plausible ligand poses.\n\n#### How it works:\n- Represent molecules as **graphs** (atoms = nodes, bonds = edges).\n- Predict **translational, rotational, and torsional changes** rather than absolute 3D coordinates.\n- Apply **random noise** to initial poses and train a neural network to reverse this process (reverse diffusion).\n- At inference, generate multiple candidate poses ranked by confidence.\n\n> *Equation shown:*  \n> `arg min_{ỹ ∈ {apply(y',x)}} RMSD(y, ỹ) · penalty(x, ỹ)`  \n> → Minimizes structural deviation while penalizing implausible configurations.\n\nVisuals show the **reverse diffusion process** evolving from noisy, scattered poses to tightly clustered, correct binding modes.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Flexible Sidechains**\n\nMost docking tools assume rigid proteins. DiffDock-Pocket explicitly models **sidechain flexibility** around the binding site.\n\n#### Approach:\n- Use **computationally generated unbound structures** aligned to bound crystal structures via “sidechain conformer matching.”\n- Train the model to predict optimal **torsional angles** for sidechains to minimize distance to the true bound structure.\n\nThis enables accurate predictions even when starting from **apo (unbound)** protein structures — a major practical advantage since many targets lack bound structures.\n\n---\n\n## 📊 **Results & Evaluation**\n\nAll experiments use the **PDBBind** benchmark and **ESMFold2-generated apo structures** (in silico predicted structures).\n\n### A. **Docking Results**\nTwo plots compare performance on:\n- **Crystal Holo Structure** (true bound structure)\n- **ESMFold2 Apo Structure** (predicted unbound structure)\n\nMetrics: Fraction of cases where predicted pose has **Top-1 RMSD < threshold (Å)**.\n\n✅ **Findings**:\n- DiffDock-Pocket (**Ours**) consistently outperforms baselines: **SMINA** (classical), **GNINA** (ML-enhanced), and their rigid variants.\n- Performance remains strong even with **apo structures**, showing robustness.\n\n---\n\n### B. **Sidechain Results**\nTwo plots evaluate sidechain prediction quality:\n\n1. **SC-RMSD (Sidechain RMSD)**: Measures accuracy of predicted sidechain positions.\n2. **Improvement over baseline**: Shows how much better our method is at refining sidechains.\n\n✅ **Findings**:\n- Achieves lower SC-RMSD than SMINA and GNINA.\n- Demonstrates significant improvement over \"Optimal\" baseline (which assumes perfect ligand placement).\n\n---\n\n### C. **Performance on ESMFold2 Structures**\n\nBar charts show fraction of successful predictions (RMSD < 2Å or < 2Å SC-RMSD) across different pocket RMSD bins (<1.5Å, 1.5–5Å, >5Å).\n\n✅ **Key Result**:\n- Even for **low-quality apo structures** (high pocket RMSD), DiffDock-Pocket maintains high success rates.\n- Outperforms other methods, especially in challenging regimes.\n\n---\n\n## 🏁 **Conclusion**\n\nThe authors conclude that:\n\n> “A major limitation of current machine learning approaches is that they neither use prior information of the binding pocket nor model the receptor as flexible.”\n\nDiffDock-Pocket addresses both:\n- Uses **binding pocket constraints** to focus search.\n- Models **sidechain flexibility** for more realistic binding predictions.\n- Achieves **state-of-the-art performance** on PDBBind.\n- Is **>20x faster** than other flexible docking methods.\n- Performs well even with **in-silico generated apo structures**, making it applicable to novel targets without experimental data.\n\n---\n\n## 💡 **Significance & Impact**\n\nThis work bridges the gap between:\n- **Traditional physics-based docking** (accurate but slow)\n- **Modern deep learning docking** (fast but often rigid and inaccurate)\n\nBy integrating **diffusion models**, **graph representations**, **prior biological knowledge**, and **flexible sidechains**, DiffDock-Pocket sets a new standard for **accuracy, speed, and applicability** in virtual screening and structure-based drug design.\n\n---\n\n## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Authors & Affiliations**\n\n- **Michael Plainer, Marcella Toth, Simon Dobers, Hannes Stärk, Gabriele Corso, Céline Marquet, Regina Barzilay**\n- Affiliated with **TUM (Technical University of Munich)** and **MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)**\n\n---\n\n## 📚 Reference\n\n[1] Corso et al., *DiffDock: Diffusion Steps, Twists, and Turns for Molecular Docking.*  \n*(Cited as foundational work for the diffusion framework used here.)*\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Final Takeaway\n\n**DiffDock-Pocket is a breakthrough method that combines diffusion modeling with biological realism to achieve fast, accurate, and flexible molecular docking — especially valuable for drug discovery pipelines using predicted protein structures.**\n\n--- \n\nLet me know if you’d like a visual walkthrough, comparison table of methods, or explanation of technical terms!\n\n---## Image 3\n\nThis image is a research poster titled **“Grounding Code Generation with Input-Output Specifications”**, authored by Yeming Wen, Pengcheng Yin, Kenshen Shi, Henryk Michalewski, Swarat Chaudhuri, and Alex Polozov, affiliated with The University of Texas at Austin and Google.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 **Overall Goal**\n\nThe work addresses the challenge of generating accurate code from natural language (NL) intents by leveraging **Input-Output (I/O) specifications** to ground and improve large language models (LLMs) for code generation — especially in complex data manipulation tasks using libraries like pandas.\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Key Sections & Summary\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Motivation**\n\n- **Problem**: Natural language intents are often ambiguous, especially for complex data operations (e.g., pandas DataFrame manipulations). Even with I/O specs, current code LLMs can fail to generate correct code.\n- **Solution Proposed**: Use auxiliary I/O specifications to reduce ambiguity and align generated code with intended behavior.\n- **Example Task**:\n  - *Intent*: “Get average duration to and from all cities for each airline.”\n  - *Input*: DataFrame with columns: `airline`, `source_city`, `destination_city`\n  - *Output*: DataFrame with columns: `Airline`, `Delhi`, `Mumbai`, `Chennai`\n  - *Challenge*: Vanilla model generates incorrect code; instruction-tuned model succeeds when grounded with I/O spec.\n\n> ✅ **Key Insight**: I/O specs help bridge the gap between vague NL intent and precise code execution.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **GIFT4Code Methodology**\n\nGIFT4Code stands for **Grounded Instruction Fine-Tuning for Code Generation**.\n\n#### Core Components:\n\n- **Step 1: Generate Intents with Code Context**\n  - Use few-shot prompting + PALM to generate 7,500 NL intents based on real CSV files from GitHub.\n  - Example: “Show the top three countries with the highest GDP”\n\n- **Step 2: Execute Code & Collect Results**\n  - Run generated code to obtain actual input/output data.\n  - E.g., output might be a list: `[\"USA\", \"China\", \"Japan\"]` or a DataFrame.\n\n- **Step 3: Augment Intents with I/O Specs Derived from Execution**\n  - Automatically derive I/O specifications (TypeDesc, Examples, Summaries) from execution results.\n  - These are added inline to the original intent to create a richer training signal.\n\n#### Types of I/O Specifications Used:\n\n| Type          | Description                                                                 |\n|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **TypeDesc**   | Variable name & type (e.g., `pandas.DataFrame`)                             |\n| **I/O Examples** | Concrete input/output examples (e.g., df with columns Bangalore(float), Chennai(float)) |\n| **I/O Summary** | LLM-generated summary of salient columns/features (e.g., “output has columns Delhi, Mumbai...”) |\n\n> 💡 GIFT4Code uses synthetic data generated by the LLM itself and leverages execution-derived signals to fine-tune the model — enabling better alignment with complex specifications.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Specifications (Table)**\n\nA table outlines how I/O specs vary across abstraction levels:\n\n- **TypeDesc**: Low-level typing info.\n- **I/O Examples**: Concrete sample inputs/outputs.\n- **I/O Summary**: High-level semantic summaries.\n\nThese serve as grounding signals during fine-tuning.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Experiments**\n\n#### Dataset:\n- Evaluated on **ARCADE**, a dataset focused on data wrangling and exploratory analysis using pandas in Jupyter notebooks.\n\n#### Base Model:\n- **62B parameter Code LLM**, pre-trained on web documents and GitHub code.\n\n#### Training Setup:\n- Fine-tuned on synthetic dataset w.r.t. three types of I/O specs.\n- Compared against zero-shot, few-shot prompting, and other baselines (StarCoder, WizardCoder).\n\n#### Results (pass@k metrics):\n\n| Method                          | pass@5 (No Context) | pass@5 (Full Context) | pass@20 (No Context) | pass@20 (Full Context) |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|\n| **Code LLM (no spec.)**         | 12.45                | 24.67                  | 19.85                 | 37.47                   |\n| **+ TypeDesc**                  | 15.96                | 30.98                  | 26.35                 | 42.30                   |\n| **+ I/O Examples**              | 19.85                | 32.47                  | 30.79                 | 43.23                   |\n| **+ I/O Summary**               | **23.75**            | **37.11**              | **34.50**             | **46.75**               |\n| **Synthetic Fine-tuning (GIFT4Code)** | 20.78 → **28.01**    | 34.33 → **43.79**      | 33.40 → **43.04**     | 46.94 → **55.47**       |\n\n> 🏆 **Best Performance**: Achieved using **I/O Summaries** and **synthetic fine-tuning (GIFT4Code)** — significantly outperforming baseline and few-shot methods.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Conclusion & Contributions**\n\n- Introduced **GIFT4Code**, a novel method that improves code LLMs via grounded instruction tuning using synthetic data and execution-derived I/O specs.\n- Demonstrated that **I/O summaries** are particularly effective for improving code generation accuracy.\n- Showed that fine-tuning with synthetic data beats few-shot prompting.\n- Highlighted the importance of **execution feedback** in aligning generated code with user intent.\n\n---\n\n## 📌 Visual Highlights\n\n- **Left Panel**: Motivational example showing failure vs success with I/O specs.\n- **Center Diagram**: Three-step pipeline of GIFT4Code (intent → execute → augment).\n- **Right Panel**: Experimental results table showing clear performance gains with I/O specs and GIFT4Code.\n- Logos: UT Austin CS + Google indicate institutional collaboration.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Takeaway Message\n\n> **To generate reliable code from natural language, ground your LLMs with executable I/O specifications — especially high-level summaries derived from actual code execution.

The authors identify a key mechanism behind CO: the emergence of **pseudo-robust shortcuts** — fragile, superficial decision rules that allow models to resist simple attacks (like FGSM) but fail to learn genuine robustness. They propose a novel method, **Layer-Aware Adversarial Weight Perturbation (LAP)**, to prevent these shortcuts and thereby mitigate CO.\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Key Findings & Contributions\n\n### 1. **Layer-Specific Sensitivity During CO**\n- **Before CO**: Models have smooth, flat loss landscapes across all layers.\n- **During CO**: The model’s loss landscape becomes sharply distorted, especially in **earlier layers** (e.g., 1st–5th), indicating heightened sensitivity.\n- **After CO**: Decision boundaries are severely distorted; earlier layers show the most damage.\n\n> ✅ *Figure 1* visualizes this through 3D loss landscapes for individual layers and the full model before, during, and after CO.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Pseudo-Robust Shortcuts Are Layer-Dependent**\n- These shortcuts arise primarily in **earlier layers** and are linked to **large singular values** in weight matrices (convolution kernels).\n- After CO, the variance of singular values increases significantly — especially in early layers — leading to sharper, less generalizable decision boundaries.\n  \n> ✅ *Figure 2* plots singular value distributions across layers (1st, 5th, 9th, 13th, 17th), showing increased variance post-CO.\n\n- Removing large weights from early layers (in CO-affected models) **reduces accuracy under FGSM** (which exploits shortcuts) but **increases accuracy under PGD** (a stronger attack), revealing the paradoxical nature of pseudo-robustness.\n\n> ✅ *Figure 3* shows this performance paradox via accuracy vs. removal rate curves for FGSM and PGD.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Proposed Method: Layer-Aware Adversarial Weight Perturbation (LAP)**\n\nLAP is designed to **disrupt the formation of pseudo-robust shortcuts** by applying adaptive, layer-specific perturbations to weights during training:\n\n#### Three Key Strategies:\n1. **Accumulate weight perturbations** — maintain larger magnitude alterations to break persistent shortcuts.\n2. **Concurrent input + weight perturbations** — simultaneously perturb inputs and weights to prevent stable shortcut formation.\n3. **Gradually decreasing perturbation strategy** — apply stronger perturbations to earlier layers, weakening as you go deeper (to avoid unnecessary redundancy).\n\n> ✅ *Equation 1*: Optimization objective of LAP — minimizes worst-case loss over adversarial perturbations to both inputs and weights.\n\n> ✅ *Equation 2*: Gradually decreasing perturbation schedule per layer `l`:\n> ```\n> λₗ = β · [1 - (ln(l)/ln(L+1))ᵞ]\n> ```\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Theoretical Justification**\n- The authors derive a **PAC-Bayes bound** for their LAP method, showing that its generalization error can be controlled.\n- This provides theoretical grounding for why LAP helps prevent CO by promoting more stable, robust learning.\n\n---\n\n## 📌 Summary of Contributions\n\n| Aspect | Contribution |\n|--------|------------|\n| **Problem Understanding** | Identifies “pseudo-robust shortcuts” in early layers as root cause of CO. |\n| **Empirical Analysis** | Shows layer-wise distortion of loss landscapes and singular value dynamics during CO. |\n| **Methodology** | Proposes LAP — a layer-aware, adaptive weight perturbation technique to disrupt shortcuts. |\n| **Theoretical Support** | Provides PAC-Bayes bounds to justify generalization guarantees of LAP. |\n| **Practical Impact** | Successfully mitigates CO while preserving or improving robustness against strong attacks like PGD. |\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Implications & Future Work\n\n- **Reveals hidden failure modes** in adversarial training: models may appear robust to weak attacks but lack true robustness.\n- **Highlights importance of layer-aware design** in adversarial defense methods.\n- **Opens new directions** for analyzing and controlling shortcut learning in deep networks beyond adversarial settings.\n\n---\n\n## 📎 Additional Resources\n\n- **Project/GitHub**: [https://github.com/tmllab/2024_ICML_LAP](https://github.com/tmllab/2024_ICML_LAP)\n- QR code provided for quick access to paper and code.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Conclusion\n\nThis work offers a **deep, layer-aware analysis** of catastrophic overfitting, uncovering the role of **pseudo-robust shortcuts** in early network layers. By introducing **LAP**, it not only explains CO but also provides an effective solution to prevent it — bridging empirical observations with theoretical guarantees.

It bridges the gap between two existing objectives — Detailed Balance (DB) and Trajectory Balance (TB) — using a hyperparameter λ that controls the weighting of partial trajectories.\n\n---\n\n## 🔷 Key Sections & Summary\n\n### 1. **Generative Flow Networks – GFlowNets**\n- **Definition**: GFlowNets are probabilistic models that sample discrete or compositional objects (e.g., molecules, graphs) from a target distribution proportional to an unnormalized reward function R.\n- **Process**: Sampling is modeled as a sequential decision-making problem starting from an initial state s₀, following a stochastic policy P_F, until reaching a terminating state.\n- **Training Goal**: Make the marginal probability over terminating states match the reward: P_F(x) ∝ R(x).\n- **Learning Objectives**:\n  - **Flow Matching (FM)**: Matches forward and backward flows on edges.\n  - **Detailed Balance (DB)**: Balances flow between adjacent states.\n  - **Trajectory Balance (TB)**: Balances the entire trajectory’s flow against the reward.\n- **Policy Parametrization**: Uses state flows F(s→t;θ), policies P_F(−|s;θ), and P_B(−|s;θ).\n- **On-policy vs Off-policy**: Training can use trajectories sampled from current policy or stored/replayed trajectories.\n\n> *Table compares FM, DB, TB by parametrization and locality.*\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Main Findings**\nThe proposed **SubTB(λ)** method:\n1. **Improves convergence** of GFlowNets in previously studied environments.\n   - Better sample efficiency and less sensitivity to hyperparameters.\n2. **Enables training in harder environments** with sparse rewards or long action sequences.\n3. **Explained by lower variance** in stochastic gradients.\n   - λ interpolates between high-bias/low-variance DB and low-bias/high-variance TB.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Subtrajectory Balance Objective (SubTB(λ))**\n- **Concept**: Generalizes “detailed balance” to subtrajectories — segments of full trajectories.\n- **Objective Function**:\n  ```\n  L_SubTB(τ_m,n) = [log (F(s_m;θ) * Π P_F(s_i+1|s_i;θ)) / (F(s_n;θ) * Π P_B(s_i|s_i+1;θ))]^2\n  ```\n- For a complete trajectory τ, SubTB(λ) uses a convex combination of losses over all subtrajectories, weighted by λ^(n−m).\n- **Hyperparameter λ > 0**:\n  - Controls weight assigned to subtrajectories of different lengths.\n  - λ → 0⁺: Approximates DB (local, edge-level)\n  - λ → ∞: Approximates TB (global, full-trajectory)\n  - λ = 1: Uniform weighting across subtrajectories.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Selected Experiments**\n\n#### 🟢 Hypergrid Environment\n- **Setup**: Grid navigation tasks with varying sizes (8×8 to 32×32), some “hard” variants with sparse rewards.\n- **Result**: SubTB(λ=0.9) consistently converges faster than TB across all grid sizes, especially in hard variants.\n- **Visualization**: Heatmaps show more accurate goal-state discovery with SubTB.\n\n#### 🟢 Bit Sequence Task\n- **Goal**: Generate bit sequences correlated with a reward function.\n- **Left Plot**: SubTB(λ) policies achieve highest correlation with reward across variants.\n- **Right Plot**: SubTB discovers more modes (diverse solutions) faster than alternatives.\n\n#### 🟢 Biological Sequence Generation\n- **Tasks**: Generating antimicrobial peptides (AMP) and fluorescent proteins (GFP).\n- **Metrics**: Top-100 Reward and Top-100 Diversity.\n- **Results**:\n  - SubTB(λ) outperforms DB, TB, SAC, AAC-ER, MCMC in both reward and diversity.\n  - Example: In GFP, SubTB achieves 1.18±0.10 reward vs 0.76±0.19 for TB.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Gradient Analysis of SubTB(λ)**\n- **Small-batch SubTB(λ) gradient** is shown to be a good estimator of large-batch TB gradient.\n- Despite having bias, it estimates the **full-batch TB gradient better** than small-batch TB itself.\n- **Interpolation Property**: SubTB(λ) smoothly interpolates between unbiased TB gradients and biased DB gradients.\n- **Graph**: Shows cosine similarity between gradients during training — SubTB(λ) aligns well with TB gradient while being more stable.\n\n---\n\n## 📌 Conclusion & Contributions\n\n- Introduces **SubTB(λ)**, a flexible, variance-reduced training objective for GFlowNets.\n- Demonstrates **faster convergence**, **improved stability**, and **superior performance** in diverse domains including synthetic grids, bit sequences, and biological sequence design.\n- Provides theoretical grounding via gradient analysis and empirical validation across multiple benchmarks.\n- Offers practical guidance: λ ≈ 0.9 often works well, balancing bias and variance effectively.\n\n---\n\n## 📎 Additional Resources\n- QR codes link to the **paper** and **GFlowNet Tutorial** for further reading.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Overall Takeaway\n\nThis work significantly advances GFlowNet training by introducing **SubTB(λ)** — a principled, scalable, and empirically powerful method that improves convergence and enables application to complex, real-world problems like drug discovery and protein design. The interpolation mechanism via λ provides a tunable trade-off between local and global learning signals, making it robust across environments.\n\n--- \n\n✅ **Poster Design Note**: Clean layout with purple/green accents, clear sectioning, mathematical rigor balanced with intuitive visuals (graphs, heatmaps, diagrams).

They prove that under standard regularity conditions, this algorithm converges to the globally optimal policy at a **sublinear rate**, even when using function approximation.\n\nThey further extend the algorithm to an **off-policy setting** and introduce **pessimism** into policy evaluation — aligning with recent empirical successes — making it the first provably convergent multi-agent PPO algorithm in cooperative Markov games.\n\n---\n\n## 📚 **Problem Setup**\n\n- **Fully-cooperative Markov Games**: Defined as tuple $ M = (N, \\mathcal{S}, \\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{P}, r, \\gamma) $, where:\n  - $ N $: number of agents\n  - $ \\mathcal{S} $: state space\n  - $ \\mathcal{A} $: joint action space\n  - $ \\mathcal{P} $: transition probability\n  - $ r $: reward function\n  - $ \\gamma \\in [0,1) $: discount factor\n\n- **Policy**: Joint policy $ \\pi: \\mathcal{S} \\to \\Delta(\\mathcal{A}) $, denoted in bold $ \\boldsymbol{\\pi} $.\n- **Value Function**: $ V^\\pi(s) = \\mathbb{E}_{a \\sim \\pi} \\left[ \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^t r(s_t, a_t, b_t) \\mid s_0 = s \\right] $\n\n- **Multi-agent Notations**:\n  - Subscript $ k $ denotes the $k$-th agent.\n  - Bold symbols without superscript refer to all agents.\n  - For subset $ P \\subset N $, $ Q_\\pi^P(s, \\boldsymbol{a}^P) $ is the multi-agent action value function for agents in $ P $.\n  - Complement set $ \\bar{a} = \\{a^i \\mid i \\notin P\\} $\n  - Multiagent advantage function: $ A_\\pi^P(s, \\boldsymbol{a}^P, \\boldsymbol{a}^{P'}) = Q_\\pi^{P \\cup P'}(s, \\boldsymbol{a}^P, \\boldsymbol{a}^{P'}) - Q_\\pi^P(s, \\boldsymbol{a}^P) $\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 **Motivation & Challenges in MARL**\n\nDespite empirical success (e.g., Go, StarCraft II), theoretical foundations for policy optimization in MARL are limited. Key challenges:\n\n1. **Non-stationarity**: One agent’s action affects others’ rewards and state transitions.\n2. **Scalability**: Joint action space grows exponentially with number of agents.\n3. **Function Approximation**: State and action spaces are often high-dimensional or continuous.\n\nThe paper aims to overcome these via a structured, provably convergent algorithm.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ **Algorithm Design: Multi-Agent PPO for Online Setting**\n\nThe core idea: use **log-linear parametrization** to build a conditional dependency structure among agents’ policies. This allows **local optimization per agent** while still targeting **global optimality**, leveraging the decomposition of the multi-agent advantage function.\n\n### Algorithm 1: Multi-Agent PPO\n\n- Input: Markov game, penalty parameter $ \\beta $, stepsize $ \\eta $, iterations $ K $\n- Initialize: $ \\theta_0^m = 0 $ for all agents $ m \\in \\mathcal{N} $\n- For each iteration $ k = 0, ..., K-1 $:\n  - Set stepsize $ \\beta_k \\leftarrow \\beta / \\sqrt{K} $\n  - For each agent $ m = 1, ..., N $:\n    - Sample trajectories from current policy $ \\pi_{\\theta_k} $\n    - Estimate advantage function $ \\hat{Q}_{\\pi_{\\theta_k}}^{1:m}(s, \\mathbf{a}^{1:m-1}, a^m) $\n    - Feed samples into **Algorithm 3** (Policy Improvement Solver) to obtain update $ \\theta_{k+1}^m $\n- Return final policy $ \\bar{\\pi} = \\pi_{\\theta_K} $\n\n### Parametrization\n\nEach agent’s conditional policy is log-linear:\n\n$$\n\\pi_{\\theta^m}(a^m | s, \\mathbf{a}^{1:m-1}) = \\frac{\\exp(\\phi^\\top(s, \\mathbf{a}^{1:m-1}, a^m)\\theta^m)}{\\sum_{a^m \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\exp(\\phi^\\top(s, \\mathbf{a}^{1:m-1}, a^m)\\theta^m)}\n$$\n\nWhere $ \\phi $ is a feature vector, and $ \\theta^m \\in \\Theta \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d $ lies in a convex, norm-constrained set ($ \\|\\theta\\|_2 \\leq 1 $).\n\n### Algorithm 3: Policy Improvement Solver for MA-PPO\n\n- Input: Markov game, iterations $ T $, stepsize $ \\eta $, samples\n- Initialize $ \\theta_0 = 0 $\n- For $ t = 0, ..., T-1 $:\n  - Compute gradient update based on advantage estimates\n  - Project onto constraint set $ \\Pi_\\Theta $\n- Output: Updated policy parameters\n\n---\n\n## 📈 **Results**\n\n### Theorem 1 (Informal)\nIn the online setting, after $ K $ iterations, the suboptimality gap $ J(\\pi^*) - J(\\bar{\\pi}) $ is upper bounded by:\n$$\nO\\left( \\frac{N}{1-\\gamma} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\log(|\\mathcal{A}|)}{K}} \\right)\n$$\n\n### Pessimistic MA-PPO with Linear Function Approximation\n\nTo reduce overestimation (common in off-policy RL), the authors introduce **pessimism** via regularization.\n\n### Theorem 2 (Informal)\nIn the off-policy setting with pessimistic evaluation, after $ K $ iterations:\n$$\nJ(\\pi^*) - J(\\bar{\\pi}) \\leq O\\left( \\frac{N}{(1-\\gamma)^2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\log(|\\mathcal{A}|)}{K}} + \\frac{c}{(1-\\gamma)^2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\log(\\frac{NK}{\\delta})}{K}} \\right)\n$$\n\nThis shows convergence despite statistical errors from off-policy sampling.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **Conclusions**\n\n1. Proposed a **multi-agent PPO algorithm** where each agent’s policy is updated sequentially, mimicking vanilla PPO.\n2. Adopted **log-linear function approximation** and proved **sublinear convergence** to global optimum.\n3.

It introduces a novel method for training neural networks to identify and extract modular, reusable theorems from formal mathematical proofs — mimicking human mathematicians’ ability to organize proofs into lemmas.\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 **Summary Overview**\n\nThe core idea is that **human theorem proving relies on modular reasoning** — breaking complex proofs into reusable components (lemmas/theorems). REFRACTOR uses machine learning (specifically, Graph Neural Networks) to automatically discover such components from existing proof trees in the Metamath library, enabling more efficient and scalable automated theorem proving.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 **Key Contributions**\n\n1. **Methodology**:  \n   - A GNN-based model trained to classify nodes in proof trees as “target” theorems.\n   - Uses node-level binary classification with cross-entropy loss.\n   - Input: Proof tree graphs with node features (character-level tokenization of names and propositions).\n   - Architecture: K GraphSage convolution layers → fully connected layers → sigmoid output.\n\n2. **Dataset & Preprocessing**:  \n   - Applied to `set.mm` (Metamath’s largest library), containing 27,220 theorems.\n   - Filtered proofs >1000 nodes or with long character strings (>512 chars).\n   - Target-wise split: Theorems extracted are different across train/val/test sets to test generalization.\n   - Subsampled to max 100/10 data points per theorem for train/test to balance dataset.\n\n3. **Proof Expansion**:  \n   - Since original Metamath proofs lack explicit targets for extraction, they created a synthetic dataset via “proof expansion” — expanding proofs to reveal intermediate steps that could be extracted as lemmas.\n   - Figure 2 illustrates this with proof trees for `a1i` and `mp1i`, showing how expanded nodes (in blue) become targets.\n\n4. **Performance Metrics**:\n   - Achieved **19.6% non-trivial accuracy** in extracting unseen human-defined theorems.\n   - Model accuracy scales with size (from 50k to 4M parameters), as shown in Table 1.\n   - Extracted **1907 new theorems** from expanded dataset + **16 from original**, totaling **1923 unique new theorems** (Table 2).\n\n5. **Usefulness of Extracted Theorems**:\n   - Used extracted theorems to refactor `set.mm`, compressing it and improving theorem prover success rate.\n   - Table 3 shows metrics like “Total Usage”, “Nodes Saved” — e.g., 375,126 nodes saved total.\n   - Table 4 compares provers under 5-minute limit: REFRACTOR proves **632 out of 2720 test theorems**, outperforming baselines (Holophram’20: 557, Symbolic Baseline: 566, MetaGen: 600), with **31.0% of proofs using newly extracted theorems**.\n\n---\n\n## 📊 **Visual Highlights**\n\n- **Figure 1**: Histograms show #theorems vs. #occurrences — highly skewed (long-tail distribution), indicating most theorems are rarely used. Subsampling helps balance this.\n- **Figure 2**: Diagrams of proof trees for `a1i` and `mp1i`, illustrating how expanded nodes (blue) are labeled as targets for extraction.\n- **Tables**:\n  - **Table 1**: Accuracy increases with model size — e.g., 4M parameter model achieves 97.9% training node accuracy, 85.6% test proof accuracy.\n  - **Table 2**: Analysis of predictions — many “invalid” predictions are actually valid theorems (Tree & Valid = 3460 in training).\n  - **Table 3**: Refactoring impact — significant node savings and usage statistics.\n  - **Table 4**: REFRACTOR outperforms baselines in proving test theorems, with notable usage of new theorems.\n\n---\n\n## 💡 **Insights & Implications**\n\n- **Human-like abstraction**: REFRACTOR mimics how humans decompose proofs into reusable lemmas — a key step toward more human-aligned AI reasoning.\n- **Generalization**: Model can extract theorems not seen during training, suggesting learned patterns generalize beyond memorization.\n- **Practical utility**: Newly extracted theorems improve automated provers — demonstrating real-world value beyond theoretical interest.\n- **Scalability**: Performance improves with larger models, suggesting potential for even stronger results with scale.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **Conclusion**\n\nREFRACTOR presents a compelling approach to **automated theorem extraction** using graph neural networks on formal proof structures. By learning to identify useful modular components, it enhances both the efficiency and capability of automated theorem provers. The method not only extracts known theorems with high accuracy but also discovers new, valid theorems that improve downstream performance — bridging the gap between human intuition and machine learning in formal mathematics.\n\n---\n\n## 🏷️ Keywords\n\nAutomated Theorem Proving, Graph Neural Networks, Metamath, Lemma Extraction, Proof Compression, Formal Methods, Machine Learning for Mathematics, REFACTOR, Theorem Discovery.\n\n--- \n\nThis work represents a significant step toward **AI systems that can autonomously discover and reuse mathematical knowledge** — a foundational goal in AI-assisted formal reasoning.\n\n---"

He will be succeeded by his deputy, **Dana Perino**. The announcement was made public during a press briefing where President George W. Bush stood alongside both Snow and Perino.\n\n---\n\n### **Presidential Response**\nPresident Bush expressed **sadness at accepting Snow’s resignation**, but also admiration for his service. In an unusually personal tone, Bush praised Snow’s performance — calling it “a joy to watch him spar with you” — and voiced confidence in Snow’s recovery, saying he believes Snow “will battle cancer and win.” Bush concluded with the heartfelt words: *“I love you, and I wish you all the best.”*\n\n---\n\n### **Tony Snow’s Perspective**\nSnow addressed reporters immediately after Bush, offering candid and emotionally resonant reflections:\n\n- **Financial Motivation**: He stated he was leaving partly to **earn more money**. His salary at the White House ($168,000) was significantly lower than what he earned at Fox News, and his family had taken out a loan that was now depleted.\n  \n- **Emotional Reflection**: Despite the challenges, Snow called his time as press secretary “a dream” and “a blast,” expressing deep satisfaction with his experience.\n\n- **Future Plans**: He plans to continue public commentary via radio and television, though he has no intention of returning to full-time anchoring.\n\n- **Health Advocacy**: Snow found meaning in speaking openly about his illness, viewing it as a way to help others facing similar struggles.\n\n---\n\n### **Medical Background & Current Status**\nSnow’s cancer journey has been well-documented:\n\n- **Initial Diagnosis (February 2005)**: Diagnosed with colon cancer; underwent surgery to remove his colon and completed six months of treatment. Cancer went into remission.\n\n- **Recurrence (March 27)**: A tumor was discovered and removed from his abdomen. Perino publicly announced the recurrence, underscoring the administration’s transparency.\n\n- **Recent Updates (Two Weeks Prior)**: Sources indicated Snow planned to leave as early as September, suggesting this decision was not sudden.\n\n- **Latest Medical Update (Thursday Interview)**:\n  - MRI and CAT scans showed tumors are **stable with no new growths**.\n  - Hair turning gray due to chemotherapy; expects black hair to regrow in about one month.\n  - Gaining weight and feeling good after a vacation.\n\n- **Upcoming Treatment**: Snow will consult his oncologist to begin **maintenance chemotherapy** — indicating a long-term, manageable approach to his illness.\n\n---\n\n### **Professional Background**\nBefore joining the White House in April 2006 (replacing Scott McClellan), Snow had a distinguished media career:\n\n- Anchor of *Fox News Sunday*.\n- Political analyst for Fox News Channel since 1996.\n- Host of *The Tony Snow Show* on Fox News Radio.\n\nHis background in journalism made him uniquely suited to navigate the high-pressure environment of the White House press corps.\n\n---\n\n### **Succession & Transition**\nWhile Dana Perino is named as Snow’s successor, the article provides **minimal detail about her** or the transition plan. Her role is acknowledged primarily to signal continuity — the focus remains firmly on Snow’s departure rather than Perino’s ascension.\n\n---\n\n### **Media & Digital Elements**\nThe article concludes with standard web features:\n\n- A prompt to **watch video footage** of the announcement.\n- An option to **email the story to a friend**, encouraging social sharing.\n\nThese elements reflect modern digital journalism’s emphasis on multimedia engagement and reader interaction.\n\n---\n\n### **Narrative Structure & Tone**\nThe article follows the **inverted pyramid structure**, leading with the most critical facts before expanding into context, quotes, and background. It balances:\n\n- **Official statements** (Bush’s remarks, White House attribution),\n- **Personal narrative** (Snow’s candid reflections),\n- **Medical chronology** (diagnosis → remission → recurrence → current stability),\n- **Professional legacy** (media career, appointment).\n\nTone-wise, the piece blends **respect, warmth, and hope**. Snow is portrayed not as a victim of illness, but as a resilient, humorous, and deeply human figure who served with distinction while managing personal hardship.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Themes & Takeaways**\n\n1. **Human-Centered Journalism**: The story centers on Snow’s humanity — his financial pressures, emotional gratitude, health advocacy, and future optimism — making it far more than a routine personnel update.\n\n2. **Balanced Narrative**: While cancer is central, it’s never presented as the sole reason for his departure. Financial reality, professional fulfillment, and institutional transition are equally emphasized.\n\n3. **Leadership Empathy**: Bush’s personal farewell adds emotional depth and reinforces the administration’s supportive culture.\n\n4. **Hopeful Outlook**: Medical updates emphasize stability and progress, reducing fear and stigma around cancer.\n\n5. **Legacy Over Transition**: Though Perino is named, the article focuses on honoring Snow’s contributions — framing his exit as a dignified, celebrated chapter closing, not merely a vacancy being filled.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment**\nThis article exemplifies **exemplary political storytelling** — combining factual rigor with emotional resonance. It transforms a high-profile resignation into a moving portrait of integrity, resilience, and grace under pressure. By giving Snow space to speak for himself — financially, emotionally, medically, and professionally — the piece ensures readers don’t just learn *what happened*, but understand *why it matters* and *how it feels*.\n\n> **In essence: Tony Snow leaves not because he failed, but because he lived fully — serving his country, fighting illness, supporting his family, and inspiring others — all while maintaining humor, humility, and heart.**\n\n--- \n\n✅ **Summary in One Sentence**:  \n*White House Press Secretary Tony Snow, battling cancer and facing financial strain, announces his resignation effective September 14, receiving warm praise from President Bush and leaving behind a legacy of wit, courage, and public service, to be succeeded by Dana Perino.*\n\n---\n## Images\n## Image 1\n\nThis image is a research poster titled **“Regularized Behavior Cloning for Blocking the Leakage of Past Action Information”**, presented by Seokin Seo, HyeongJoo Hwang, Hongseok Yang, and Kee-Eung Kim from KAIST, likely at a conference such as NeurIPS (as indicated by the “Neural Information Processing Systems” logo).\n\nThe poster introduces a novel method called **PALR (Past Action Leakage Regularization)** to improve imitation learning from observation histories (ILOH), where state information (e.g., velocity) is missing — a common challenge in real-world applications like autonomous driving or robotics.\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Core Problem: Past Action Leakage in ILOH\n\nIn **Imitation Learning from Observation Histories (ILOH)**, agents learn from sequences of observations (e.g., images or positions over time) without direct access to underlying state variables (like velocity). The agent must infer state from past observations.\n\nHowever, a critical issue arises:\n> **Unnecessary past action information leaks into the policy**, causing the agent to rely on *what it did before* rather than what it observes now. This leads to:\n- **Copycat problem**: Agent repeats past actions regardless of current context.\n- **Inertia problem**: Agent fails to adapt quickly to new situations.\n\nThis leakage harms generalization and performance.\n\n---\n\n## 📊 Quantifying Leakage: HSCIC Metric\n\nTo measure this leakage, the authors propose using **HSCIC (Hilbert-Schmidt Conditional Independence Criterion)** — a kernel-based, non-parametric statistic that quantifies conditional dependence between variables.\n\n### Key Insight:\n- Leakage = `I(a_{t-1}^E; φ_t | a_t^E)` → Mutual information between past expert action and current representation, conditioned on current expert action.\n- HSCIC estimates this conditional independence without assuming distributions or requiring nested optimization.\n\n**Advantages of HSCIC:**\n1. ✅ No nested optimization\n2. ✅ No additional neural network needed\n3. ✅ Non-parametric → no distributional assumptions\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Proposed Solution: PALR Framework\n\nInstead of regularizing actions directly (as in traditional methods like FCA), the authors propose to **regularize representations** learned by the policy network.\n\n### Objective Function:\n```\nL(π, φ; z_t_w, a_{t-1}^E, a_t^E, α) := L_bc(π, φ; z_t_w, a_t^E) + α · L_reg(φ; z_t_w, a_{t-1}^E, a_t^E)\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `L_bc` = standard behavior cloning loss\n- `L_reg` = regularization term based on HSCIC → minimizes dependence of representation `φ_t` on past action `a_{t-1}^E`, given current action `a_t^E`\n\nThis is their **PALR (Our Approach)**.\n\n### Comparison with Other Regularizers:\n\n| Method              | Type               | Notes |\n|---------------------|--------------------|-------|\n| Conditional Entropy | Neural Estimator   | Coincides with FCA [1] |\n| Decomposed MI       | Neural Estimator   | Still has limitations |\n| **HSCIC (PALR)**    | Kernel Estimator   | ✔️ Our approach — avoids nested opt, extra nets, dist. assumptions |\n\n---\n\n## 📈 Experimental Results\n\nExperiments are conducted on **POMDP versions of D4RL benchmark tasks** (hopper, walker2d, halfcheetah, ant, carla-lane), which simulate partial observability.\n\n### Performance Evaluation Table:\n- PALR consistently outperforms baselines: BC, KF, PrimeNet, RAP, FCA, MINE.\n- Example: On `walker2d-v2` with w=4, PALR achieves **83.4 ± 5.4**, significantly better than FCA (79.8) and MINE (68.7).\n\n### Key Findings:\n1. **Negative correlation** between HSCIC (leakage) and performance → Lower leakage = higher score.\n2. **PALR reduces leakage during training** (shown in graph a).\n3. **Optimal regularization coefficient α** exists — too little or too much hurts performance (graph b).\n\n### Quantitative Analysis:\nTable shows final HSCIC estimates for trained policies — PALR achieves the **lowest leakage** across most tasks.\n\n---\n\n## 🚫 Limitations of Prior Methods\n\nThe poster highlights shortcomings of existing approaches:\n1. Nested optimization (computationally expensive)\n2. Requires additional neural networks (increases complexity)\n3. Restricted flexibility due to parametric assumptions\n\nPALR overcomes all three.\n\n---\n\n## 📚 References\n\nCitations support key concepts:\n- [1] Wen et al., NeurIPS 2020 — copycat/inertia problems in ILOH\n- [2] Codevilla et al., ICCV 2019 — limitations in behavior cloning for driving\n- [3] Park et al., NeurIPS 2020 — HSCIC theory\n- [4] Fu et al., arXiv 2020 — D4RL dataset\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Summary & Contributions\n\n**Problem**: In ILOH, agents leak past action info → poor generalization.\n\n**Solution**: Introduce **PALR**, a regularization framework that minimizes past action leakage via **HSCIC**.\n\n**Key Innovations**:\n- Uses **non-parametric HSCIC** to quantify and penalize leakage.\n- Regularizes **representations**, not actions.\n- Avoids nested optimization, extra networks, and distributional assumptions.\n\n**Results**:\n- Strong empirical performance across POMDP D4RL tasks.\n- Demonstrated reduction in leakage correlates with improved performance.\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Takeaway\n\nThis work provides a principled, practical, and effective way to mitigate a fundamental flaw in imitation learning under partial observability. By focusing on **representation-level regularization** using a theoretically grounded metric (HSCIC), PALR enables more robust and adaptive policies — especially valuable for safety-critical applications like autonomous vehicles or robotics.\n\n--- \n\n✅ **Poster Design Note**: Well-organized layout with clear sections, visual diagrams, mathematical formulations, and experimental results. Emphasizes novelty through red highlights and arrows pointing to contributions.

The paper introduces novel knowledge distillation-based algorithms for federated learning (FL) that are agnostic to model architecture and data distribution, aiming to improve performance under heterogeneous settings.\n\n---\n\n## 🧭 **Motivation**\n\nCurrent federated learning methods often rely on restrictive assumptions about model structure or data homogeneity. The authors ask: *Can we design model-agnostic FL algorithms that allow each agent to train their own preferred model on the combined dataset?* This is crucial for real-world applications where agents may use different models or have non-IID data.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ **Framework: Federated Kernel Regression**\n\nThe paper uses **kernel regression** as a theoretical framework to analyze the problem:\n\n- Two agents: Agent 1 has dataset 𝒟¹ = (𝐗¹, 𝐲¹), Agent 2 has 𝒟² = (𝐗², 𝐲²).\n- Goal: Learn optimal mappings g¹* ∈ ℱ₁ and g²* ∈ ℱ₂ minimizing:\n  \n  ```\n  g¹* = arg min_g [ (1/N₁)Σ(y¹ₙ - g(𝐱¹ₙ))² + (1/N₂)Σ(y²ₙ - g(𝐱²ₙ))² + cRᵤ₁(g) ]\n  ```\n\n  where Rᵤ₁(g) is a regularization term based on kernel u₁.\n\nThis setup allows analysis of how knowledge can be exchanged between agents with potentially different models and datasets.\n\n---\n\n## 🔁 **Alternating Knowledge Distillation (AKD)**\n\n### Algorithm:\n1. Agent 1 trains on its data to get gᵗ₁.\n2. Agent 2 uses gᵗ₁ to predict labels on its data → gets pseudo-labels ŷᵗ₊₁².\n3. Agent 2 trains on its data + pseudo-labels → gets gᵗ₊₁².\n4. Agent 1 receives gᵗ₊₁² and predicts labels on its data → gets ŷᵗ₊₁¹.\n5. Repeat.\n\nThis alternates training and distillation between agents.\n\n### Key Insight:\nAKD can be viewed as alternating projections interspersed with contractions — similar to projecting one agent’s knowledge onto the other’s data. However, mismatches lead to information loss.\n\n### Proposition I:\nThere exist oblique projection operators P₁ᵗ, P₂ᵗ, contraction matrices C₁, C₂, and orthogonal matrices V₁, V₂ such that the model learned by AKD in round 2t has a closed-form expression involving these operators.\n\n### Proposition II (Informal):\nConvergence rate to g(x)=0 improves if:\n- Stronger inductive bias (larger c),\n- Kernels k₁ and k₂ are very different,\n- Dataset difference (measured by k₁(x,y)) increases.\n\n> **Figure 1**: Visualizes AKD over 2 rounds.  \n> **Figure 2**: Geometric intuition — alternating oblique projections converge to 0.\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 **Averaged Knowledge Distillation (AvgKD)**\n\n### Algorithm:\nSame as AKD, but instead of using only the latest model, agents **average** all previous models when making predictions.\n\n### Proposition III:\nUnder AvgKD, there exist projection/contraction matrices such that the model learned by Agent 1 converges to a limit expressed as:\n\n```\ng¹ₜ(x) = (mₓ/2) Σ_{i=0}^{t−1} (C₁P₂ᵀC₂P₁ᵀ/4)^i z₁ + (mₓC₁P₂ᵀ/4) Σ_{i=0}^{t−2} (C₂P₁ᵀC₁P₂ᵀ/4)^i z₂\n```\n\nIn the limit (t→∞), this becomes:\n\n```\nlim g¹ₜ(x) = (mₓ/2)(I − C₁P₂ᵀC₂P₁ᵀ/4)† z₁ + (mₓC₁P₂ᵀ/4)(I − C₂P₁ᵀC₁P₂ᵀ/4)† z₂\n```\n\n### Important Note:\nWhile AvgKD **does not degrade** like AKD and converges to a stable point, this limit is **not** the desired optimal model (i.e., it doesn’t recover g¹*).\n\n> **Figure 3**: Diagram of AvgKD scheme.  \n> **Figure 4**: Intuition — ensemble built from alternating models corrects bias and converges to true optimum.\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 **Ensembled Knowledge Distillation (EKD)**\n\n### Algorithm:\nRun **two parallel AKD processes** — one starting from Agent 1, another from Agent 2 — generating sequences {gᵗ₁} and {gᵗ₂}. Then construct an infinite ensemble:\n\n```\nf∞(x) = Σ_{t=0}^∞ (-1)^t (gᵗ₁(x) + gᵗ₂(x))\n```\n\n> **Note**: Use odd steps with positive sign, even steps with negative sign.\n\n### Proposition IV:\nThis ensemble f∞ satisfies f∞(𝐗ᵢ) = g¹*(𝐗ᵢ) for i ∈ {1,2}, meaning it recovers the optimal model predictions on both datasets.\n\nHowever, this comes at the cost of maintaining an infinite ensemble — impractical in practice.\n\n---\n\n## 📊 **Experiments**\n\n### Toy Experiment (Linear Regression)\n- Problem: Solve Ax* = b.\n- Compare: Centralized, Agent 1, Agent 2, AKD, AvgKD, EKD.\n- **Figure 5 (i.i.d.)**: AvgKD and EKD perform well; AKD degrades.\n- **Figure 6 (heterogeneous)**: AKD fails quickly; AvgKD stabilizes; EKD matches centralized.\n\n### Real-World Experiments (MNIST & CIFAR10)\nUsed neural networks with varying data heterogeneity controlled by hyperparameter **Alpha**:\n- Alpha = 0 → completely different datasets (max heterogeneity)\n- Alpha = 1 → i.i.d. split\n\n#### Results:\n- **Figure 7 (MNIST)**: \n  - AKD degrades rapidly as rounds increase.\n  - AvgKD stabilizes but doesn't match centralized accuracy.\n  - EKD matches centralized performance (but requires large ensembles).\n- **Figure 8 (CIFAR10)**:\n  - Similar trends, but EKD shows **no improvement** over centralized — possibly because models operate near NTK regime where averaging helps less.\n\n---\n\n## 📌 **Key Findings / Results Summary**\n\n1. **AvgKD > AKD**: \n   - AvgKD stabilizes regardless of regularization, model, or data heterogeneity.\n   - AKD degrades faster under heterogeneity or regularization.\n   - AvgKD does **not** reach centralized accuracy.\n\n2. **EKD Needs Large Ensembles**:\n   - Matches centralized accuracy in synthetic settings.\n   - In real world (MNIST/CIFAR10), improvement is slow or nonexistent — likely due to models operating near Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime where simple averaging suffices.\n\n3. **Data Heterogeneity is the Main Bottleneck**:\n   - Performance degradation in AKD is primarily due to mismatch between agents’ data and models.\n   - Higher data heterogeneity → faster degradation.\n   - AvgKD improves over local models and scales better with heterogeneity.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **Conclusion & Contributions**\n\nThe paper makes significant contributions to model-agnostic federated learning:\n\n- Proposes **AKD**, **AvgKD**, and **EKD** — three knowledge distillation schemes for federated learning.\n- Provides **theoretical analysis** using kernel regression, showing convergence properties and limitations.\n- Demonstrates via experiments that **AvgKD is robust and practical**, while **EKD is theoretically optimal but costly**.\n- Highlights **data heterogeneity** as the primary challenge in knowledge distillation-based FL.\n\nThese methods offer promising directions for deploying federated learning in realistic, heterogeneous environments without requiring model alignment.\n\n---\n\n## 🏷️ Keywords\n\nFederated Learning, Knowledge Distillation, Model Agnosticism, Data Heterogeneity, Kernel Methods, Ensemble Learning, Convergence Analysis, Neural Networks, MNIST, CIFAR10\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Target Audience\n\nResearchers and practitioners in machine learning, especially those working on federated learning, distributed optimization, and model personalization under data/model heterogeneity.\n\n--- \n\nThis work bridges theory and practice in federated learning, offering both mathematical insights and empirical validation of scalable, model-agnostic approaches.\n\n---",

Bush’s upcoming speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), in which he seeks to reframe public and political discourse around the Iraq War by drawing deliberate historical parallels — particularly with the Vietnam War — to argue against withdrawal.\n\n---\n\n### **Core Argument & Rhetorical Strategy**\n\nBush’s central tactic is to **reframe the Vietnam analogy**, traditionally used by critics to condemn prolonged U.S. involvement in Iraq, into a justification for staying. He argues that withdrawing from Vietnam led to catastrophic human consequences — “boat people,” “re-education camps,” and the “killing fields” of Cambodia — and that such outcomes are what Americans should fear if they pull out of Iraq. He further links the Vietnam withdrawal to emboldening terrorists, citing Osama bin Laden’s claim that America would abandon its commitments as it did in Vietnam.\n\nBush also contrasts domestic skepticism with how global adversaries interpret U.S. actions, warning that terrorists see American hesitation as weakness — thereby framing continued engagement not just as strategic, but as morally imperative to preserve U.S. credibility abroad.\n\n---\n\n### **Broader Historical Context**\n\nTo strengthen his argument, Bush extends the historical narrative beyond Vietnam:\n\n- **Post-WWII Japan**: Once seen as impossible to democratize, Japan became a stable, free society — illustrating that long-term U.S. commitment yields positive results despite initial criticism.\n- **Korean War**: Critics called it futile, but U.S. persistence prevented South Korea from falling under repression — reinforcing the theme of American reliability and moral responsibility.\n\nThese comparisons serve to construct a broader narrative: **short-term pain leads to long-term peace and stability**, and abandoning missions invites chaos and tyranny.\n\n---\n\n### **Opposition Response**\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid sharply rejects Bush’s analogies, calling them misleading and historically inaccurate. He accuses the administration of launching the war under “false pretenses” and labels it “the worst foreign policy blunder in recent history.” Reid insists it’s time to change direction and promises Congressional action in the fall — positioning Democrats as ready to challenge executive policy if the Petraeus report fails to show meaningful progress.\n\n---\n\n### **Political & Strategic Context**\n\nThe White House deliberately timed Bush’s speech to precede the highly anticipated September 2007 progress report from General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker. The goal is to shape public and legislative perception *before* the report’s release, urging lawmakers to withhold judgment until then.\n\nDefense Secretary Robert Gates adds nuance by stating he will wait for the report before deciding on troop drawdowns — highlighting internal divisions even within the administration. Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers express nervousness over the political fallout of an increasingly unpopular war.\n\n---\n\n### **Public Opinion Data**\n\nPolling data from CNN/Opinion Research underscores a stark disconnect between White House messaging and public sentiment:\n\n- **64% oppose the Iraq War**\n- **72% say Petraeus’ progress report won’t change their view**\n- **53% do not trust Petraeus to give an accurate assessment**\n\nThese figures reveal deep public disillusionment and suggest that Bush’s rhetorical efforts may be ineffective in swaying opinion — exposing a significant “credibility gap” between leadership and the electorate.\n\n---\n\n### **Structural & Journalistic Purpose**\n\nThe article functions as a **political news analysis and speech preview**, combining direct quotes, historical context, opposition critique, and empirical polling data. Its tone remains neutral but informative, allowing readers to evaluate competing narratives without overt editorializing.\n\nIt follows a classic persuasive structure:\n1. **Thesis**: Bush reframes Vietnam to justify staying in Iraq\n2. **Evidence**: Quotes, historical examples\n3. **Counterargument**: Reid’s rebuttal\n4. **Supporting data**: Polls and reactions\n5. **Implied conclusion**: Public skepticism challenges the effectiveness of Bush’s framing\n\n---\n\n### **Key Themes**\n\n1. **Historical Analogizing** – Using past conflicts to legitimize current policy.\n2. **Credibility & Legacy** – Fear that withdrawal damages U.S. global standing and emboldens enemies.\n3. **Public Disillusionment** – High opposition and distrust in leadership undermine presidential messaging.\n4. **Political Tension** – Executive vs. legislative branches; growing GOP anxiety.\n5. **Strategic Timing** – Speeches designed to influence debate before the pivotal Petraeus report.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Takeaway**\n\nThis article is more than a speech preview — it’s a sophisticated examination of **how political leaders use history, language, and timing to manage public perception during crisis**. It reveals a presidency attempting to control the narrative amid declining support, while also documenting the rising tide of dissent and skepticism from both Congress and the American public. Ultimately, it frames the upcoming Petraeus report not just as a military update, but as a potential turning point in the war’s political fate — where rhetoric meets reality, and legacy hangs in the balance.\n\n> **In one sentence**:  \n> *As President Bush invokes Vietnam, Japan, and Korea to defend continued U.S. involvement in Iraq, this article dissects his rhetorical strategy, exposes the widening gap between official messaging and public opinion, and highlights the high-stakes political drama unfolding ahead of the Petraeus report.*\n\n---\n## Images\n## Image 1\n\nThis academic poster, titled **“Viewing Transformers Through the Lens of Long Convolutions Layers”** by Itamar Zimerman and Lior Wolf from Tel Aviv University, presents a novel analysis of why long convolutional layers outperform standard Transformers in long-range sequence modeling tasks — and introduces a new attention mechanism, **LaS (Local and Smooth) Attention**, to bridge this performance gap.\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Background & Motivation\n\nThe research is motivated by the observation that **long convolutional models** (e.g., S4, Mega, SGConv) significantly outperform Transformers on tasks requiring long-range dependencies — such as speech classification, DNA modeling, and long-document understanding.\n\nThe authors aim to understand **why Transformers underperform** compared to these long-conv layers. They hypothesize that the key differentiator lies in the **inductive biases** inherent in convolutional layers — specifically, **locality** and **smoothness** — which are not naturally present in vanilla self-attention mechanisms.\n\nThey explore three core questions:\n1. **Expressiveness**: Can Transformers express the same functions as long conv layers? → *Yes*, via Theorem B.1: one self-attention head can simulate one channel of a state-space layer.\n2. **Optimization**: Do optimization issues prevent Transformers from learning long-range patterns? → *Probably not*, since performance improves with more data.\n3. **Inductive Bias**: Is the lack of built-in locality/smoothness the real bottleneck? → *Yes*, this is the focus of their proposed solution.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Method: LaS (Local and Smooth) Attention\n\nTo inject the desired inductive biases into Transformers, the authors propose **LaS Attention**, which modifies the standard attention mechanism with two key operations:\n\n1. **Per-row 1D Average Pooling** — applied across the rows of the attention matrix to enforce **smoothness**.\n2. **Exponentially Decaying Matrix Multiplication** — introduced before softmax to enhance **locality** (i.e., favoring nearby tokens).\n\n> ✅ **Result**: LaS Attention produces **more continuous and localized attention matrices** compared to vanilla attention, visually demonstrated in heatmaps (Layer-10 comparisons).\n\nThe architecture diagram shows how LaS replaces the original attention head while preserving the Q/K/V computation, adding only lightweight operations for pooling and decay.\n\n---\n\n## 📊 Results\n\n### 1. **Long Range Arena (LRA) Benchmark**\n\nLaS Attention consistently outperforms standard Transformers and even rivals or exceeds specialized long-range models like Reformer, Linformer, BigBird, Performer, and Luna-256 across all LRA tasks:\n\n| Model             | ListOps | Text   | Retrieval | Image  | Pathfinder |\n|-------------------|---------|--------|-----------|--------|------------|\n| Transformer†      | 36.37   | 64.27  | 57.46     | 42.44  | 71.40      |\n| Local Attention†  | 15.82   | 52.98  | 53.39     | 41.46  | 66.63      |\n| XFM†              | 37.11   | 65.21  | 79.14     | 42.94  | 71.83      |\n| **LaS (ours)**    | **53.05** | **79.28** | **85.56** | **70.44** | **81.62**  |\n| LaS-chunk (ours)  | 46.21   | 79.11  | 83.84     | 64.90  | 54.61      |\n\n> 🚀 **LaS achieves state-of-the-art or near-SOTA results** on most LRA tasks, especially excelling in “Retrieval” and “Pathfinder”.\n\n### 2. **Small-Scale Language Modeling (Text8 & Enwik8)**\n\nLaS also improves performance on small-scale language modeling benchmarks:\n\n| Model            | Text8     | Enwik8    |\n|------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Vanilla Attention| 1.3557    | 1.2885    |\n| **LaS Attention**| **1.3332**| **1.2826**|\n\nA training curve graph confirms that LaS converges faster and achieves lower perplexity than vanilla attention.\n\n---\n\n## 🧾 Conclusions\n\nThe paper makes two major contributions:\n\n1. **Understanding Long Convolutions**:  \n   The authors demonstrate that the superior performance of long convolutional layers stems from their built-in **inductive biases of smoothness and locality** — not from expressiveness or optimization limitations.\n\n2. **Introducing LaS Attention**:  \n   A simple yet effective modification to self-attention that incorporates these biases, leading to **significant improvements on long-range modeling tasks** across multiple benchmarks.\n\n> 💡 **Key Insight**: By mimicking the structural properties of successful long-conv layers, Transformers can be enhanced without abandoning their core architecture.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Implications\n\n- This work bridges the gap between convolutional and attention-based architectures for long-sequence modeling.\n- LaS Attention is computationally lightweight and easy to integrate into existing Transformer models.\n- It opens the door to further exploration of inductive biases in neural architectures — particularly for tasks where context spans hundreds or thousands of tokens.\n\n---\n\n## 🖼️ Visual Highlights\n\n- **Figure 1**: Shows kernel plots from S4, Mega, and SGConv — illustrating their smooth, localized structure.\n- **Architecture Diagram**: Clearly contrasts original vs. LaS attention heads.\n- **Heatmaps**: Visually show how LaS attention generates smoother, more diagonal attention patterns than vanilla attention.\n- **Training Curves**: Demonstrate faster convergence and better final performance for LaS.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Final Verdict\n\nThis is a **highly insightful and well-executed study** that identifies a critical architectural limitation of Transformers in long-range modeling and provides an elegant, empirically validated solution. LaS Attention represents a promising direction for improving Transformers without sacrificing scalability or interpretability.\n\n---\n\n📌 **QR Code Note**: The QR code likely links to the full paper or project page (not accessible here).\n\n---\n\n**Summary in One Sentence**:  \n*By analyzing the inductive biases of long convolutional layers, this work introduces LaS Attention — a simple yet powerful variant of self-attention that enhances Transformers’ ability to model long-range dependencies, achieving state-of-the-art performance on key benchmarks.*\n\n---"

    "llm_output_test1": "result: **Three-Minute Speed-Read: *The Three-Body Problem* by Liu Cixin**\n\nIn the midst of China’s Cultural Revolution, a young astrophysicist named Ye Wenjie witnesses her father’s brutal execution for “bourgeois science.” Traumatized and disillusioned with humanity, she later joins a top-secret military project — Red Coast Base — designed to communicate with extraterrestrial civilizations. In a moment of despair, she sends a signal into space… and receives a reply.\n\nThat reply comes from Trisolaris — a planet orbiting a chaotic triple-star system where life has evolved under extreme instability. The Trisolarans, desperate to escape their dying world, plan to invade Earth. But first, they deploy a terrifying weapon: sophons — subatomic particles unfolded into two dimensions and programmed to sabotage human scientific progress. They’re invisible, omnipresent, and capable of monitoring every word, thought, and experiment on Earth.\n\nMeanwhile, decades later, nanomaterials researcher Wang Miao is drawn into a mysterious series of suicides among top scientists. He discovers a virtual reality game called “Three Body,” which simulates the unpredictable, apocalyptic cycles of Trisolaran civilization. As he dives deeper, he uncovers the truth: the game is a recruitment tool for the Frontiers of Science — a secret society aiding the Trisolarans’ invasion.\n\nThe novel weaves together hard science, political history, and existential dread. At its core, *The Three-Body Problem* asks: What if humanity isn’t alone — and what if the aliens aren’t benevolent? Liu Cixin presents a chilling vision of cosmic sociology: in a universe governed by survival, trust is naive, and communication can be fatal. The “Dark Forest” theory — introduced later in the trilogy — suggests that civilizations hide because revealing themselves invites annihilation.\n\nKey themes:\n- **The fragility of human progress**: Sophons cripple physics research, showing how easily knowledge can be suppressed.\n- **Moral ambiguity**: Ye Wenjie’s betrayal stems from trauma, not malice — forcing readers to question whether humanity deserves salvation.\n- **Cosmic indifference**: The universe isn’t hostile — it’s indifferent. Survival depends on strategy, not morality.\n- **Science as both savior and weapon**: Technology enables contact with aliens — and also dooms us.\n\nImportant concepts:\n- **The Three-Body Problem**: A real physics puzzle describing the unpredictability of three gravitationally interacting bodies — mirroring the chaos of Trisolaris and the moral instability of human choices.\n- **Sophons**: Quantum-level spies that lock humanity out of advanced physics — a brilliant sci-fi twist on scientific censorship.\n- **The Frontiers of Science**: Not just traitors — they’re idealists who believe Trisolaran rule might bring order to our self-destructive species.\n\nTakeaways:\n1. Trust no one — especially when the stakes are interstellar.\n2. Progress can be fragile; knowledge is power — and a target.\n3. Humanity’s greatest threat may not be alien monsters — but our own capacity for destruction and betrayal.\n4. In the cosmos, silence may be the only safe strategy.\n\nLiu Cixin blends Chinese history, cutting-edge physics, and philosophical depth into a gripping thriller that redefines first contact. *The Three-Body Problem* isn’t just about aliens — it’s about what we become when faced with extinction, and whether we deserve to survive.\n\nReady for the sequel? You’ll need it — because the worst is yet to come.\n\n*(Word count: 478 — perfect for a 3-minute read.)*",

    "llm_output_test2": "result: **Three-Minute Speed-Read: *One Hundred Years of Solitude* by Gabriel García Márquez**\n\nIn the heart of the Colombian jungle, nestled between mountains and rivers, lies the mythical town of Macondo — a place born from dreams, shaped by magic, and destined for oblivion. This is the stage for *One Hundred Years of Solitude*, Gabriel García Márquez’s 1967 masterpiece that redefined literature with its blend of realism and fantasy — a style now known as “magical realism.”\n\nThe novel chronicles the rise and fall of the Buendía family over seven generations, beginning with patriarch José Arcadio Buendía, a restless dreamer who founds Macondo after fleeing his village following a murder. His wife, Ursula Iguarán, is the family’s moral anchor — pragmatic, resilient, and fiercely protective of her clan through wars, loves, madness, and time itself.\n\nAs Macondo evolves from an Edenic village into a bustling, then decaying, town touched by colonialism, capitalism, and civil war, so too does the Buendía family spiral through cycles of passion, solitude, and self-destruction. Names repeat — José Arcadios and Aurelianos — each generation echoing the last, trapped in patterns of love, violence, and isolation. The most haunting theme? **Solitude** — not just physical loneliness, but existential alienation, inherited and inescapable.\n\nGarcía Márquez weaves the fantastical into the mundane: a girl ascends to heaven while folding laundry; yellow butterflies follow a man wherever he goes; it rains for four years, eleven months, and two days. These aren’t whimsies — they’re metaphors. Magic becomes a lens to examine Latin America’s history: colonization, exploitation, political upheaval, and cultural identity. The banana company massacre (a fictionalized version of real events) is a chilling indictment of foreign imperialism and historical erasure.\n\nKey characters include:\n- **Melquíades**, the gypsy who brings magnets and ice to Macondo — symbolizing wonder and the arrival of modernity.\n- **Colonel Aureliano Buendía**, who leads 32 failed revolutions and retreats into making tiny gold fish — embodying futility and disillusionment.\n- **Remedios the Beauty**, whose ethereal beauty causes men to die — representing unattainable ideals and the destructive power of obsession.\n- **Amaranta Úrsula**, the final Buendía, whose passionate reunion with her nephew triggers the family’s apocalyptic end.\n\nThe book’s ending is both poetic and devastating: as the last Buendía deciphers the prophetic parchments left by Melquíades, Macondo is erased by a hurricane — as if it had never existed. The message? History repeats, memory fades, and civilizations — like families — are fragile vessels adrift in time.\n\n**Essential Takeaways:**\n- Solitude is not just loneliness — it’s the human condition when disconnected from meaning, memory, or community.\n- History is cyclical — unless we learn from it, we’re doomed to repeat it.\n- Magical realism isn’t escapism — it’s a way to express truths too complex for pure realism.\n- Love, ambition, and memory are powerful — but without connection, they lead to ruin.\n\n*One Hundred Years of Solitude* is more than a novel — it’s a myth, a mirror, and a monument to Latin America’s soul. It reminds us that even in the most fantastical worlds, the deepest truths are painfully human.\n\n**Read it. Let it haunt you. Then read it again — because like Macondo, it lingers long after the last page.**",

    "llm_output_test3": "result: **Three-Minute Speed-Read Summary: *Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils* by Jin Yong**\n\nJin Yong’s *Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils* — the third novel in his “Condor Trilogy” — is an epic wuxia masterpiece that weaves together martial arts, romance, political intrigue, and Buddhist philosophy into a sprawling tale of identity, destiny, and redemption. Set during the chaotic 11th-century Song Dynasty, it follows three protagonists whose lives intertwine across borders, clans, and cultures — each grappling with their own demons, desires, and destinies.\n\n**The Three Heroes:**\n\n1. **Qiao Feng (Xiao Feng)** – The mighty leader of the Beggar Sect, revered for his strength and honor. But when his true heritage as a Khitan (a northern “barbarian” people) is revealed, he becomes an outcast overnight. His journey is one of tragic nobility — torn between loyalty to his adopted homeland and the blood of his ancestors, Qiao Feng embodies the cost of prejudice and the burden of truth.\n\n2. **Duan Yu** – A carefree prince of the Dali Kingdom who hates violence but stumbles into martial arts mastery through accidental encounters with forbidden techniques like the “Lingbo Weibu” (Floating Steps) and “North Maitreya Fist.” His innocence contrasts sharply with the world’s brutality, and his romantic entanglements — especially with the elusive Wang Yuyan — drive much of the emotional core.\n\n3. **Xu Zhu** – A simple-minded monk from the Shaolin Temple who unwittingly breaks monastic vows and inherits immense power from the legendary “Heavenly Dragon Sect.” His story explores themes of fate and humility — how even the most unassuming soul can become a force of cosmic balance.\n\n**Central Themes:**\n\n- **Identity & Belonging**: Each hero struggles with who they are versus who they’re expected to be. Qiao Feng’s ethnic crisis, Duan Yu’s royal duty vs. personal freedom, and Xu Zhu’s spiritual conflict all ask: Can we choose our destiny, or is it written in blood?\n\n- **Love & Obsession**: Romance here is rarely sweet — it’s tangled, obsessive, and often destructive. Duan Yu’s infatuation with Wang Yuyan, who loves only her cousin Murong Fu, mirrors the broader theme of unrequited longing and the pain of chasing illusions.\n\n- **Buddhist Philosophy**: The title itself — *Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils* — references the Six Realms of Rebirth in Buddhism. Characters cycle through suffering, pride, desire, and delusion, ultimately seeking enlightenment. Even the most powerful warriors are shown as flawed, transient beings caught in karma’s web.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n✅ **No one is purely good or evil** — heroes fall, villains rise, and moral lines blur.\n✅ **Destiny can be defied, but not escaped** — characters fight fate, yet their paths are shaped by choices made long before.\n✅ **Power comes with isolation** — the stronger you become, the lonelier you grow.\n✅ **True strength lies in compassion** — Qiao Feng’s final sacrifice, Duan Yu’s forgiveness, and Xu Zhu’s humility reveal that wisdom surpasses martial prowess.\n\n**Why It Matters:**\n\nMore than just sword fights and secret manuals, *Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils* is a meditation on what it means to be human — flawed, yearning, and capable of greatness despite our limitations. Jin Yong masterfully blends history, myth, and emotion to create a timeless saga that resonates far beyond its genre.\n\nIn under three minutes, you’ve absorbed the soul of this monumental work: a tale where gods falter, devils repent, and ordinary souls rise — not because they’re destined to, but because they choose to.\n\n**Final Thought:** In a world of chaos, your true name isn’t given by blood or title — it’s forged by the choices you make when no one’s watching."

This node converts the uploaded file into readable text.\n\n3. **LLM Node**: This is the core translation component. The LLM will:\n   - Analyze the extracted source code\n   - Identify all dependencies (both built-in and custom)\n   - Generate the main structure of the code in the target language\n   - For classes and functions, provide only signatures without implementations\n   - Ensure all dependencies are properly identified and included\n\n   The prompt will be carefully crafted to:\n   - Reference the source language and target language from user input\n   - Reference the extracted code text\n   - Instruct the LLM to focus on structure only (first stage)\n   - Emphasize the importance of identifying all dependencies\n\n4. **End Node**: Outputs the translated code structure as `target_code`\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n- The file input requires extraction before LLM processing\n- The LLM prompt must clearly specify this is stage 1 (structure only)\n- Dependencies analysis is critical and must be emphasized in the prompt\n- The output should be properly formatted code in the target language",

Placing queens row by row (since each row must contain exactly one queen)\n2. For each row, trying each column position\n3. Validating if the position is safe (no conflicts with previously placed queens)\n4. If valid, recursively placing queens in the next row\n5. If we reach the end (all rows filled), we have a complete solution\n6. Backtracking by removing the last placed queen to try alternative positions\n\n### Component Breakdown\n\n#### 1. `solve_n_queens(n)` - Main Function\n- **What it does**: Entry point that initializes data structures and starts the backtracking process\n- **Why it's needed**: Provides a clean interface for users to solve the N-Queens problem\n- **How it works**: \n  - Creates an empty board initialized with '.' characters\n  - Calls the backtracking function starting from row 0\n  - Returns all found solutions\n\n#### 2. `is_valid(row, col)` - Validation Function\n- **What it does**: Checks if placing a queen at position (row, col) is valid\n- **Why it's needed**: Ensures no two queens can attack each other (the core constraint of the problem)\n- **How it works**:\n  - **Column check**: Loops through all rows in the target column to see if any queen exists\n  - **Row check**: Loops through all columns in the target row to see if any queen exists  \n  - **Diagonal checks**: Four while loops check all four diagonal directions:\n    - Upper-left (row--, col--)\n    - Lower-right (row++, col++)\n    - Upper-right (row--, col++)\n    - Lower-left (row++, col--)\n\n#### 3. `backtrack(row)` - Core Backtracking Function\n- **What it does**: Recursively tries to place queens row by row\n- **Why it's needed**: Implements the depth-first search with backtracking strategy\n- **How it works**:\n  - **Base case**: When `row == n`, we've successfully placed queens in all rows → add solution\n  - **Recursive case**: For each column in current row:\n    - If position is valid, place queen\n    - Recursively call `backtrack(row + 1)` to place queens in next row\n    - After recursion returns, remove queen (backtrack) to try next column\n\n#### 4. Solution Storage and Copying\n- In the C version, solutions are stored in dynamically allocated arrays\n- In Python, we use lists to store solutions\n- When a complete solution is found, we create a copy of the current board state as a list of strings\n\n### Algorithm Complexity\n\n- **Time Complexity**: O(N!) in the worst case, though pruning reduces this significantly\n- **Space Complexity**: O(N²) for the board plus O(N) for recursion stack depth\n\n### Execution Flow\n\n1. Call `solve_n_queens(n)`\n2. Initialize empty board\n3. Call `backtrack(0)` to start placing queens in row 0\n4. For row 0, try columns 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1:\n   - If column is valid, place queen and recurse to row 1\n   - Continue until all rows are filled or no valid positions remain\n5. When all rows are filled, save the solution\n6. Backtrack by removing the last placed queen and try next position\n7. Return all collected solutions\n\n### Key Differences from C Implementation\n\n1. **Memory Management**: Python handles memory automatically; no need for malloc/free\n2. **Data Structures**: Use Python lists instead of C arrays/pointers\n3. **String Handling**: Convert board rows to strings using `''.join()` instead of manual string copying\n4. **Return Values**: Return directly rather than using pointer parameters for output\n5. **Simplification**: Removed global variables by using closure scope\n\n---\n\n## Code Annotations\n\n```python\ndef solve_n_queens(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve N-Queens problem.\n    Returns all valid solutions as a list of boards.\n    \"\"\"\n    solutions = []  # Will store all valid solutions\n    # Initialize board as 2D list of '.' characters\n    current_board = [['.' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    def is_valid(row, col):\n        \"\"\"Check if placing queen at (row, col) is safe\"\"\"\n        # Check entire column for existing queens\n        for i in range(n):\n            if current_board[i][col] == 'Q':\n                return False\n        \n        # Check entire row for existing queens  \n        for j in range(n):\n            if current_board[row][j] == 'Q':\n                return False\n        \n        # Check upper-left diagonal (moving up and left)\n        i, j = row - 1, col - 1\n        while i >= 0 and j >= 0:\n            if current_board[i][j] == 'Q':\n                return False\n            i -= 1\n            j -= 1\n        \n        # Check lower-right diagonal (moving down and right)\n        i, j = row + 1, col + 1\n        while i < n and j < n:\n            if current_board[i][j] == 'Q':\n                return False\n            i += 1\n            j += 1\n        \n        # Check upper-right diagonal (moving up and right)\n        i, j = row - 1, col + 1\n        while i >= 0 and j < n:\n            if current_board[i][j] == 'Q':\n                return False\n            i -= 1\n            j += 1\n        \n        # Check lower-left diagonal (moving down and left)\n        i, j = row + 1, col - 1\n        while i < n and j >= 0:\n            if current_board[i][j] == 'Q':\n                return False\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n        \n        return True  # No conflicts found\n    \n    def backtrack(row):\n        \"\"\"Recursively place queens row by row\"\"\"\n        # Base case: We've placed queens in all rows\n        if row == n:\n            # Create a solution by converting each row to a string\n            solution = []\n            for i in range(n):\n                solution.append(''.join(current_board[i]))\n            solutions.append(solution)  # Add to our solutions list\n            return  # Return to backtrack\n        \n        # Try each column in current row\n        for col in range(n):\n            if is_valid(row, col):  # If position is valid\n                current_board[row][col] = 'Q'  # Place queen\n                \n                backtrack(row + 1)  # Recurse to next row\n                \n                current_board[row][col] = '.'  # Remove queen (backtrack)\n    \n    backtrack(0)  # Start from first row\n    return solutions  # Return all found solutions\n```\n\nThis Python implementation maintains the same logical structure as the original C code but leverages Python's strengths for cleaner, more readable code while preserving the backtracking algorithm's efficiency.",

The input is a 2D board where empty cells are represented by `'.'`, and filled cells contain digits `'1'` through `'9'`. The goal is to fill the empty cells such that every row, column, and 3×3 subgrid contains all digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.\n\n### Main Purpose and Functionality\n- **Input**: A partially filled 9×9 Sudoku board (as a list of lists of strings).\n- **Output**: The solved board (modified in-place), or the same board if no solution exists.\n- **Algorithm**: Uses recursive backtracking — tries each digit (1–9) in empty cells, validates placement, and backtracks if no valid digit leads to a solution.\n- **Validation**: For each candidate digit, checks:\n  - No duplicate in the current row\n  - No duplicate in the current column\n  - No duplicate in the current 3×3 box\n\n---\n\n## Translated Python Code\n\n```python\ndef solve_sudoku(board):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle using backtracking.\n    Modifies the board in-place.\n    Returns the solved board.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def is_valid(row, col, val, board):\n        \"\"\"Check if placing 'val' at (row, col) is valid according to Sudoku rules.\"\"\"\n        n = len(board)\n\n        # Check row\n        for i in range(n):\n            if board[row][i] == val:\n                return False\n\n        # Check column\n        for i in range(n):\n            if board[i][col] == val:\n                return False\n\n        # Check 3x3 box\n        start_row = (row // 3) * 3\n        start_col = (col // 3) * 3\n        for i in range(start_row, start_row + 3):\n            for j in range(start_col, start_col + 3):\n                if board[i][j] == val:\n                    return False\n\n        return True\n\n    def backtrack():\n        \"\"\"Recursively try to fill the board using backtracking.\"\"\"\n        n = len(board)\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                # Skip if cell is already filled\n                if board[i][j] != '.':\n                    continue\n\n                # Try digits 1 to 9\n                for val in range(1, 10):\n                    str_val = str(val)\n                    if is_valid(i, j, str_val, board):\n                        board[i][j] = str_val\n\n                        # Recurse to next cell\n                        if backtrack():\n                            return True\n\n                        # Backtrack: reset cell if no solution found\n                        board[i][j] = '.'\n\n                # If no digit works, return False to trigger backtracking\n                return False\n\n        # All cells filled successfully\n        return True\n\n    # Start solving\n    backtrack()\n    return board\n```\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Semantic Explanation\n\n### Overall Structure and Design\n\nThe solution uses **recursive backtracking**, a classic approach for constraint satisfaction problems like Sudoku. The core idea:\n\n1. Traverse the board row by row, left to right.\n2. When an empty cell (`.`) is found, try placing digits `1` through `9`.\n3. For each digit, validate it against Sudoku constraints (row, column, 3×3 box).\n4. If valid, place it and recursively attempt to solve the rest.\n5. If recursion succeeds → return `True`.\n6. If recursion fails → undo (backtrack) and try next digit.\n7. If no digit works → return `False` to trigger higher-level backtracking.\n\nThis ensures we explore all possibilities systematically until a solution is found or all paths are exhausted.\n\n---\n\n### Breakdown of Components\n\n#### 1. `solve_sudoku(board)`\n- **Purpose**: Entry point. Calls the solver and returns the modified board.\n- **Why needed**: Encapsulates the logic and provides a clean interface.\n- **How it works**: Simply calls `backtrack()` and returns the board after solving.\n\n#### 2. `is_valid(row, col, val, board)`\n- **Purpose**: Validates whether placing `val` at `(row, col)` follows Sudoku rules.\n- **Why needed**: Ensures we only place digits that don’t violate constraints.\n- **How it works**:\n  - **Row check**: Loops through all columns in `row` to see if `val` already exists.\n  - **Column check**: Loops through all rows in `col` to see if `val` already exists.\n  - **Box check**:\n    - Computes top-left corner of the 3×3 box containing `(row, col)` using integer division:  \n      `start_row = (row // 3) * 3`, `start_col = (col // 3) * 3`\n    - Checks all 9 cells in that 3×3 box for duplicates.\n  - Returns `True` only if no conflicts are found.\n\n> 📝 Note: In Python, `//` is integer division — equivalent to `Math.floor(a / b)` in JavaScript.\n\n#### 3. `backtrack()`\n- **Purpose**: Recursive function that attempts to fill the board.\n- **Why needed**: Implements the core backtracking logic.\n- **How it works**:\n\n##### Step-by-step Execution Flow:\n\n1. **Iterate through each cell**:\n   ```python\n   for i in range(n):\n       for j in range(n):\n   ```\n   - Scans the board from top-left to bottom-right.\n\n2. **Skip filled cells**:\n   ```python\n   if board[i][j] != '.': continue\n   ```\n   - Only process empty cells.\n\n3. **Try digits 1–9**:\n   ```python\n   for val in range(1, 10):\n       str_val = str(val)\n   ```\n   - Converts int to string because board stores characters.\n\n4. **Validate placement**:\n   ```python\n   if is_valid(i, j, str_val, board):\n   ```\n   - Only proceed if digit doesn't break Sudoku rules.\n\n5. **Place digit and recurse**:\n   ```python\n   board[i][j] = str_val\n   if backtrack():\n       return True\n   ```\n   - Place the digit and recursively try to solve the rest.\n   - If recursion returns `True`, we’ve found a solution → propagate success upward.\n\n6. **Backtrack on failure**:\n   ```python\n   board[i][j] = '.'\n   ```\n   - Undo the placement if the recursive call failed (no solution from this state).\n\n7. **Return False if no digit works**:\n   ```python\n   return False\n   ```\n   - Triggers backtracking in the caller — meaning the previous move was invalid.\n\n8. **Return True if all cells filled**:\n   ```python\n   return True\n   ```\n   - Reached when nested loops complete without hitting an empty cell → solution found.\n\n---\n\n### Key Algorithmic Concepts\n\n#### Backtracking Pattern\nThis is a textbook example of backtracking:\n- **Choice**: Pick a digit for an empty cell.\n- **Constraint**: Validate against Sudoku rules.\n- **Goal**: Fill entire board.\n- **Undo**: If path fails, revert and try next option.\n\n#### Time Complexity\n- Worst-case: O(9^M) where M is the number of empty cells.\n- In practice, pruning via validation reduces search space significantly.\n\n#### Space Complexity\n- O(M) due to recursion depth (one call per empty cell).\n\n---\n\n### Why This Works\n\nSudoku has a unique solution for valid puzzles. The backtracking algorithm:\n- Systematically explores all valid placements.\n- Prunes invalid branches early via `is_valid`.\n- Guarantees finding a solution if one exists.\n- Modifies the board in-place for efficiency.\n\n---\n\n## Code Annotations (Inline Comments)\n\nSee the translated Python code above — it includes detailed inline comments explaining each major section and step.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Example\n\n```python\nboard = [\n    [\"5\",\"3\",\".\",\".\",\"7\",\".\",\".\",\".\",\".\"],\n    [\"6\",\".\",\".\",\"1\",\"9\",\"5\",\".\",\".\",\".\"],\n    [\".\",\"9\",\"8\",\".\",\".\",\".\",\".\",\"6\",\".\"],\n    [\"8\",\".\",\".\",\".\",\"6\",\".\",\".\",\".\",\"3\"],\n    [\"4\",\".\",\".\",\"8\",\".\",\"3\",\".\",\".\",\"1\"],\n    [\"7\",\".\",\".\",\".\",\"2\",\".\",\".\",\".\",\"6\"],\n    [\".\",\"6\",\".\",\".\",\".\",\".\",\"2\",\"8\",\".\"],\n    [\".\",\".\",\".\",\"4\",\"1\",\"9\",\".\",\".\",\"5\"],\n    [\".\",\".\",\".\",\".\",\"8\",\".\",\".\",\"7\",\"9\"]\n]\n\nsolved = solve_sudoku(board)\nfor row in solved:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis will output the solved Sudoku grid.\n\n---\n\n## Final Notes\n\n- This implementation assumes the input board is solvable.\n- If no solution exists, the board remains unchanged (or partially modified depending on backtracking path).\n- For production use, consider adding input validation or returning a success flag.\n\n✅ The translation preserves all original logic while adapting syntax and idioms to Python best practices.",

The key insight is that we build up solutions incrementally by considering whether to include each vertex as an intermediate point in our paths.\n\nThe 3D array structure `[i][j][k]` represents the shortest path from vertex `i` to vertex `j` using only vertices `{1, 2, ..., k}` as possible intermediate vertices.\n\n### Component Breakdown\n\n#### 1. Class Definition and Constants\n```python\nclass FloydBase:\n    MAX_VAL = 10005\n```\n- Defines a class to encapsulate the algorithm\n- `MAX_VAL` serves as \"infinity\" - representing unreachable vertices\n- Note: In Java, `Integer.MAX_VALUE` was commented out and replaced with 10005, likely to avoid overflow issues\n\n#### 2. Input Reading Section\n```python\nprint(\"1.输入N M\")\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n```\n- Reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m`\n- This sets up the problem size\n\n#### 3. 3D Grid Initialization\n```python\ngrid = [[[FloydBase.MAX_VAL for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n```\n- Creates a 3D array of size `(n+1) × (n+1) × (n+1)`\n- Uses 1-based indexing for vertices (1 to n)\n- Initializes all distances to `MAX_VAL` (infinity)\n\n#### 4. Base Case Setup\n```python\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    for j in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i == j:\n            grid[i][j][0] = 0\n        else:\n            grid[i][j][0] = FloydBase.MAX_VAL\n```\n- Sets diagonal elements to 0 (distance from any vertex to itself is 0)\n- All other distances are initially set to infinity\n\n#### 5. Edge Input Processing\n```python\nfor _ in range(m):\n    u, v, weight = map(int, input().split())\n    grid[u][v][0] = weight\n    grid[v][u][0] = weight\n```\n- Reads each edge and stores its weight\n- Since this appears to be an undirected graph, both directions are set\n- These are stored at `k=0` level (direct edges with no intermediates)\n\n#### 6. Floyd-Warshall Algorithm Core\n```python\nfor k in range(1, n + 1):\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            grid[i][j][k] = min(grid[i][k][k - 1] + grid[k][j][k - 1], grid[i][j][k - 1])\n```\nThis is the heart of the algorithm:\n\n- **Outer loop (k)**: Consider vertex `k` as a potential intermediate vertex\n- **Middle loop (i)**: Consider all possible source vertices\n- **Inner loop (j)**: Consider all possible destination vertices\n\nFor each combination `(i, j, k)`, we have two choices:\n1. **Don't use vertex k**: Keep the previous best distance `grid[i][j][k-1]`\n2. **Use vertex k**: Go from `i` to `k` then `k` to `j`, which costs `grid[i][k][k-1] + grid[k][j][k-1]`\n\nWe take the minimum of these two options.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n```\ndist[i][j][k] = min(dist[i][j][k-1], dist[i][k][k-1] + dist[k][j][k-1])\n```\n\n#### 7. Query Processing\n```python\nprint(\"3.输入[起点-终点]计划个数\")\nx = int(input())\n\nprint(\"4.输入每个起点src 终点dst\")\n\nfor _ in range(x):\n    src, dst = map(int, input().split())\n    \n    if grid[src][dst][n] == FloydBase.MAX_VAL:\n        print(\"-1\")\n    else:\n        print(grid[src][dst][n])\n```\n- Reads the number of queries\n- For each query, retrieves the shortest path from source to destination\n- The answer is found at `grid[src][dst][n]` - meaning we've considered ALL vertices (1 through n) as possible intermediates\n- If the distance is still `MAX_VAL`, it means no path exists, so output \"-1\"\n\n### Flow of Execution\n\n1. **Initialization**: Create data structures and read basic graph information\n2. **Base Case**: Set up direct edges (with no intermediates)\n3. **Dynamic Programming**: Iteratively build up solutions by considering each vertex as a potential intermediate\n4. **Query Answering**: For each query, return the precomputed shortest path distance\n\n### Why This Approach?\n\nThe Floyd-Warshall algorithm is chosen because:\n- It finds shortest paths between ALL pairs of vertices efficiently (O(n³))\n- It handles negative edge weights (as long as no negative cycles exist)\n- It's relatively simple to implement\n- The 3D array approach makes the dynamic programming state explicit\n\n### Key Insights\n\n- **Space Complexity**: O(n³) due to the 3D array\n- **Time Complexity**: O(n³) for the algorithm + O(m) for input + O(x) for queries\n- **Optimization Opportunity**: In practice, we could use a 2D array and update in-place since we only need the previous `k-1` layer, but the 3D version makes the logic clearer\n\nThis implementation provides a solid foundation for understanding the Floyd-Warshall algorithm and can be extended for more complex graph problems."

As the **reviewing party is the Tenant**, my analysis will focus on **identifying risks, unfavorable terms, ambiguities, and omissions** that could harm the Tenant’s legal or financial position — particularly around **security deposit return**, but also across all critical areas of the lease.\n\nThis is a **template from Vertex42.com**, which means it was designed to be broadly usable but may not reflect current state/local laws or best practices for tenant protection. Below is a **detailed, section-by-section risk review**, followed by **actionable recommendations** to maximize the Tenant’s interests.\n\n---\n\n# 📋 **I. SECURITY DEPOSIT CLAUSE ANALYSIS (Sections 1–30 Checkpoints Applied)**\n\n## 🔴 **RISK #1: Non-Refundable Portion of Deposit – Potentially Illegal**\n\n> **Clause:**  \n> *“A portion of the security deposit, in the amount of $________, shall be non-refundable, and shall be applied toward Landlord’s costs of preparing the Premises for occupancy by others.”*\n\n### ❗ Risk:\n- Many states (e.g., California, New York, Illinois, Washington) **prohibit non-refundable security deposits** unless clearly labeled as “non-refundable cleaning fee” or “pet fee” — and even then, only if disclosed separately and not bundled into the “security deposit.”\n- This clause attempts to make part of the deposit non-refundable under the guise of “preparing the premises,” which is vague and likely unenforceable.\n- If challenged, courts may treat the entire deposit as refundable or penalize the landlord for bad faith.\n\n### ✅ **Recommendation:**\n> **Delete or amend this clause.**  \n> Replace with:  \n> *“The entire security deposit is refundable, subject to deductions permitted by law for unpaid rent, damage beyond normal wear and tear, and cleaning costs exceeding normal use.”*  \n> Add: *“Landlord agrees not to withhold any portion of the deposit for routine turnover or preparation costs unless specifically authorized by applicable law.”*\n\n---\n\n## 🔴 **RISK #2: No Statutory Timeline for Return**\n\n> **Clause:**  \n> *“Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the security deposit shall be refundable.”*  \n> → **No mention of timeframe for return after move-out.**\n\n### ❗ Risk:\n- Most states require landlords to return the deposit within **14–30 days** after tenant vacates, depending on jurisdiction.\n- Failure to specify this timeline gives the landlord **unlimited discretion** to delay return — potentially indefinitely.\n- Tenant has no contractual basis to demand timely return or seek penalties.\n\n### ✅ **Recommendation:**\n> **Add explicit statutory deadline clause:**  \n> *“Landlord shall return the security deposit, less any lawful deductions, within [X] days after Tenant surrenders possession of the Premises and provides written notice of forwarding address, as required by [State] law. Failure to return the deposit within this period may result in statutory penalties including [double/triple damages, attorney fees, etc.] as permitted by law.”*\n\n> *Note: Tenant should research their state’s specific deposit return deadline and insert it here.*\n\n---\n\n## 🔴 **RISK #3: No Requirement for Itemized Statement or Documentation**\n\n> **Clause:**  \n> *“Landlord may use part or all of the security deposit to repair any such damage... Tenant shall remain liable for any balance.”*\n\n### ❗ Risk:\n- No requirement for **itemized list of deductions** or **supporting documentation** (photos, receipts, estimates).\n- Landlord can arbitrarily deduct without proof.\n- Tenant has no recourse unless they sue — which is expensive and time-consuming.\n\n### ✅ **Recommendation:**\n> **Add mandatory itemization clause:**  \n> *“Within [X] days of returning the deposit, Landlord shall provide Tenant with an itemized statement of all deductions, including descriptions of damage, cost breakdowns, and copies of receipts or invoices. Failure to provide such documentation renders all deductions void and entitles Tenant to full return of the deposit plus statutory penalties.”*\n\n---\n\n## 🔴 **RISK #4: No Move-In/Move-Out Inspection Protocol**\n\n> **Clause:**  \n> *None specified.*\n\n### ❗ Risk:\n- Without a formal inspection process, landlord can claim damage existed at move-in or was caused by tenant without evidence.\n- Tenant has no opportunity to dispute claims before moving out.\n\n### ✅ **Recommendation:**\n> **Add mutual inspection clause:**  \n> *“Both Parties shall conduct a joint move-in inspection within 7 days of lease commencement and sign a condition report attached hereto as Exhibit A. A similar move-out inspection shall be conducted within 7 days of Tenant vacating, with both Parties present. Tenant may request a pre-move-out walkthrough to identify issues and cure them prior to departure.”*\n\n> *Encourage Tenant to take photos/video at move-in and move-out.*\n\n---\n\n## 🔴 **RISK #5: Deposit May Be Used Toward Rent (Discretionary)**\n\n> **Clause:**  \n> *“The security deposit shall not be applied toward or deducted from any rent due under this Agreement, unless elected by Landlord, in Landlord’s sole discretion.”*\n\n### ❗ Risk:\n- This clause **gives landlord unilateral power** to apply deposit to rent — which defeats the purpose of a security deposit.\n- Could lead to landlord applying deposit to rent while still claiming damage deductions later.\n- Contradicts standard practice and may violate state laws that separate security deposits from rent payments.\n\n### ✅ **Recommendation:**\n> **Strike this clause entirely.**  \n> Replace with:  \n> *“The security deposit shall not be used to satisfy any rent obligation during the term of this Agreement. It is held solely for the purposes of covering damages beyond normal wear and tear, unpaid utilities, or cleaning costs upon termination.”*\n\n---\n\n## 🔴 **RISK #6: No Mention of Interest Accrual (If Required by Law)**\n\n> **Clause:**  \n> *None.*\n\n### ❗ Risk:\n- In some states (e.g., Massachusetts, New York City), landlords must pay interest on security deposits if held for more than a certain period.\n- Silence on this issue may allow landlord to avoid paying legally mandated interest.\n\n### ✅ **Recommendation:**\n> **Add interest clause if applicable in your state:**  \n> *“If required by [State] law, Landlord shall pay Tenant annual interest on the security deposit at the rate set by statute, compounded annually, payable upon return of the deposit.”*\n\n> *Tenant should verify local law and insert appropriate language.*\n\n---\n\n## 🔴 **RISK #7: No Penalty for Late Return**\n\n> **Clause:**  \n> *None.*\n\n### ❗ Risk:\n- No disincentive for landlord to delay return.\n- Tenant may have to file suit to recover deposit — costly and uncertain.\n\n### ✅ **Recommendation:**\n> **Add penalty clause:**  \n> *“If Landlord fails to return the deposit or provide an itemized statement within [X] days of move-out, Tenant shall be entitled to statutory penalties including [double/triple deposit amount, attorney fees, court costs], as permitted by [State] law.”*\n\n---\n\n## 🔴 **RISK #8: Deposit Can Be Withheld for “Any Damages” Without Definition**\n\n> **Clause:**  \n> *“Landlord may use part or all of the security deposit to repair any such damage to the Premises... other than reasonable wear and tear.”*\n\n### ❗ Risk:\n- “Reasonable wear and tear” is **not defined** — opens door to subjective interpretation.\n- Landlord could withhold for minor scuffs, faded paint, or worn carpet — all typically considered normal.\n\n### ✅ **Recommendation:**\n> **Define “normal wear and tear”:**  \n> *“Normal wear and tear includes, but is not limited to: minor scuff marks on walls, fading of paint or flooring due to sunlight, slight wear on carpets, and general aging of fixtures and appliances. Damage beyond normal wear and tear includes holes in walls, broken windows, stained carpets, missing fixtures, or damage caused by negligence or abuse.”*\n\n> Also add: *“Landlord bears burden of proving damage was caused by Tenant and exceeds normal wear and tear.”*\n\n---\n\n## 🔴 **RISK #9: No Forwarding Address Requirement**\n\n> **Clause:**  \n> *None.*\n\n### ❗ Risk:\n- Landlord may claim they didn’t know where to send the deposit.\n- Tenant loses right to receive deposit if they fail to provide address — unfair burden.\n\n### ✅ **Recommendation:**\n> **Add forwarding address clause:**  \n> *“Tenant shall provide Landlord with a written forwarding address within 7 days of vacating the Premises. Failure to do so shall not relieve Landlord of obligation to return the deposit; Landlord shall mail it to the last known address or hold it in escrow until claimed.”*\n\n---\n\n## 🔴 **RISK #10: Deposit Held in General Account (Not Escrow)**\n\n> **Clause:**  \n> *None.*\n\n### ❗ Risk:\n- Landlord may commingle funds — illegal in many jurisdictions.\n- If landlord goes bankrupt or misuses funds, tenant may lose deposit.\n\n### ✅ **Recommendation:**\n> **Add escrow/account clause:**  \n> *“Landlord shall hold the security deposit in a separate, interest-bearing account at a federally insured financial institution, clearly identified as a security deposit account for this Premises. Upon request, Landlord shall provide Tenant with the name and location of the bank holding the deposit.”*\n\n---\n\n# 📋 **II. OTHER HIGH-RISK CLAUSES AFFECTING TENANT RIGHTS**\n\n## 🔴 **RISK #11: Broad Indemnification Clause (Unfair Liability Shift)**\n\n> **Clause:**  \n> *“Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold Landlord harmless from any and all loss, damage or claims of any type due to the actions of Tenant, its occupants, guests or other invitees... Landlord shall not be liable for personal injury or damages or loss of Tenant’s personal property... due to theft, vandalism, fire, water, rain, hail, smoke, explosions, sonic booms or other causes whatsoever, including the negligence of Landlord.”*\n\n### ❗ Risk:\n- This clause attempts to **waive landlord’s liability for gross negligence or willful misconduct** — which is often **unenforceable** under state law.\n- It also forces tenant to indemnify landlord for injuries caused by landlord’s own negligence — which violates public policy in most states.\n\n### ✅ **Recommendation:**\n> **Limit indemnity scope and remove waiver of negligence:**  \n> *“Tenant shall indemnify Landlord only for claims arising from Tenant’s intentional acts or gross negligence. Landlord remains liable for injuries or damages caused by Landlord’s own negligence or failure to maintain common areas or structural components.”*\n\n> Add: *“No provision herein shall waive Landlord’s statutory duty to provide habitable premises or comply with health and safety codes.”*\n\n---\n\n## 🔴 **RISK #12: Mold Waiver – Unconscionable & Likely Unenforceable**\n\n> **Clause:**  \n> *“Tenant waives any and all claims against Landlord... Landlord shall not be liable for any damages... resulting from mold or mildew.”*\n\n### ❗ Risk:\n- Courts routinely strike down **mold waivers** because they violate implied warranty of habitability.\n- Landlords are legally obligated to maintain safe, habitable conditions — mold poses serious health risks.\n- This clause may also violate state-specific mold disclosure laws.\n\n### ✅ **Recommendation:**\n> **Delete entirely.**  \n> Replace with:  \n> *“Landlord warrants that the Premises are free from hazardous levels of mold at the start of the tenancy. If mold develops during the term, Landlord shall remediate it promptly upon notice from Tenant, unless caused solely by Tenant’s failure to maintain ventilation or control moisture.”*\n\n---\n\n## 🔴 **RISK #13: No Right to Cure Before Termination (Default Clause Too Harsh)**\n\n> **Clause:**  \n> *“If any default occurs more than twice in six months, third default may be deemed non-curable.”*\n\n### ❗ Risk:\n- Allows landlord to terminate lease without giving tenant chance to fix issue — even for minor breaches.\n- Violates principle of “opportunity to cure” required in many jurisdictions.\n\n### ✅ **Recommendation:**\n> **Amend to ensure cure rights:**  \n> *“Tenant shall have five (5) days to cure any default after written notice. Even if same default recurs, Tenant shall still be given opportunity to cure unless the breach involves illegal activity, violence, or abandonment.”*\n\n> Add: *“No default shall be deemed incurable unless it materially threatens health, safety, or property integrity.”*\n\n---\n\n## 🔴 **RISK #14: Vague “House Rules” Incorporation by Reference**\n\n> **Clause:**  \n> *“A copy of the additional house rules and regulations, if any, has been provided to Tenant. Tenant shall abide by... all house rules, which are incorporated herein by reference...”*\n\n### ❗ Risk:\n- Rules may be changed unilaterally by landlord.\n- Tenant may not have received actual rules — creates ambiguity.\n- Rules may include unreasonable restrictions (e.g., no guests ever, no music, etc.).\n\n### ✅ **Recommendation:**\n> **Require attachment and approval:**  \n> *“All House Rules must be attached as Exhibit B and signed by both Parties at execution. Landlord may not modify House Rules without Tenant’s written consent, except for emergency safety changes.”*\n\n> Add: *“Any rule inconsistent with this Agreement or applicable law is void.”*\n\n---\n\n## 🔴 **RISK #15: No Right to Sublet Without Consent (But Consent Not Defined)**\n\n> **Clause:**  \n> *“Tenant shall not assign this Agreement or sublet any portion of the Premises without prior written consent of the Landlord, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.”*\n\n### ❗ Risk:\n- While “not unreasonably withheld” is good, it lacks definition.\n- Landlord could deny subletting for arbitrary reasons (e.g., disliking subtenant’s race, religion, etc.) — potential discrimination.\n\n### ✅ **Recommendation:**\n> **Clarify reasonableness standard:**  \n> *“Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold consent to subletting or assignment. Denial must be based on legitimate business grounds such as creditworthiness, criminal history, or ability to perform obligations under this Agreement. Landlord shall respond to subletting requests within 14 days with written explanation if denied.”*\n\n---\n\n## 🔴 **RISK #16: No Renter’s Insurance Mandate Enforcement**\n\n> **Clause:**  \n> *“Tenant shall procure renter’s insurance... and shall provide evidence thereof to Landlord upon Landlord’s request.”*\n\n### ❗ Risk:\n- Landlord has no enforcement mechanism — tenant can ignore this.\n- If tenant doesn’t have insurance and suffers loss, landlord avoids liability — fair, but tenant needs incentive to comply.\n\n### ✅ **Recommendation:**\n> **Add consequence for non-compliance:**  \n> *“Failure to maintain valid renter’s insurance within 30 days of lease commencement shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement, entitling Landlord to terminate the lease upon 10 days’ written notice.”*\n\n> *Also recommend Tenant obtain policy immediately and share certificate.*\n\n---\n\n## 🔴 **RISK #17: No Clarification on “Abandonment” Definition**\n\n> **Clause:**  \n> *“Abandonment shall have occurred if... Tenant is absent for 15 days while rent is due and possessions remain... OR 1 day if possessions removed.”*\n\n### ❗ Risk:\n- Overly broad — tenant traveling for work or family emergency could trigger false abandonment.\n- Landlord could seize property without proper notice or hearing.\n\n### ✅ **Recommendation:**\n> **Narrow definition and add notice requirement:**  \n> *“Abandonment shall only be deemed to occur if Tenant fails to pay rent for 30 consecutive days AND does not communicate with Landlord regarding intent to return. Landlord shall send certified notice advising Tenant of potential abandonment and offering 14 days to respond or reclaim property.”*\n\n---\n\n## 🔴 **RISK #18: No Repair Obligation for Landlord (Maintenance Clause One-Sided)**\n\n> **Clause:**  \n> *“Tenant shall be responsible... for maintaining the Premises... including exterior, yard, landscaping... pest infestation... repairs required as a result of damages caused by Tenant... Landlord may, in discretion, perform repairs and charge Tenant.”*\n\n### ❗ Risk:\n- Places **all maintenance burden on tenant**, even for structural or appliance failures.\n- Landlord can charge tenant for repairs they caused — but what about natural wear?\n\n### ✅ **Recommendation:**\n> **Differentiate responsibilities:**  \n> *“Landlord shall be responsible for structural repairs, plumbing, electrical systems, heating/cooling units, roof, foundation, and major appliance replacements. Tenant shall be responsible for minor repairs, cosmetic upkeep, and damage caused by Tenant’s negligence or misuse.”*\n\n> Add: *“Landlord shall respond to repair requests within 7 days for urgent matters (leaks, no heat, etc.) and 14 days for non-urgent items.”*\n\n---\n\n## 🔴 **RISK #19: No Notice Period for Month-to-Month Renewal**\n\n> **Clause:**  \n> *“If payment of rent is so paid and accepted, this Agreement will automatically renew on a month to month basis... written notice of termination is to be given by either party at least thirty (30) days before the designated date of termination...”*\n\n### ❗ Risk:\n- Landlord can raise rent or change terms without notice during month-to-month period.\n- Tenant may not realize renewal happened unless they track payments carefully.\n\n### ✅ **Recommendation:**\n> **Add automatic notice provision:**  \n> *“Upon expiration of the initial term, if Tenant continues to occupy and pay rent, this Agreement shall convert to a month-to-month tenancy. Either Party may terminate with 30 days’ written notice delivered by certified mail or email. Landlord may not increase rent or alter material terms without 30 days’ written notice.”*\n\n---\n\n## 🔴 **RISK #20: No Dispute Resolution Mechanism**\n\n> **Clause:**  \n> *“In the event action is taken... the prevailing party shall be entitled to all costs... including reasonable attorney fees...”*\n\n### ❗ Risk:\n- Encourages litigation over small disputes.\n- Tenant may face high legal costs even if they win.\n\n### ✅ **Recommendation:**\n> **Add mediation/arbitration clause:**  \n> *“Before filing suit, Parties agree to mediate any dispute related to this Agreement through a neutral mediator selected by mutual agreement. If mediation fails, either Party may pursue arbitration or litigation as permitted by law.”*\n\n> Consider adding: *“Small claims court is encouraged for disputes under $10,000.”*\n\n---\n\n# 📋 **III. MISSING CLAUSES THAT SHOULD BE ADDED FOR TENANT PROTECTION**\n\n| Missing Clause | Why Important | Recommended Addition |\n|----------------|---------------|----------------------|\n| **Habitability Warranty** | Landlord must provide safe, livable space | *“Landlord warrants that Premises are habitable and comply with all applicable building, health, and safety codes at commencement and throughout term.”* |\n| **Rent Increase Limitation** | Prevents sudden hikes during fixed term | *“During initial term, rent shall not be increased. During month-to-month term, increases limited to [X]% per year, with 30 days’ written notice.”* |\n| **Right to Quiet Enjoyment** | Protects against harassment or interference | *“Tenant shall enjoy quiet and peaceful possession of Premises without interference from Landlord or third parties.”* |\n| **Privacy Rights / Entry Limits** | Prevents abusive inspections | *“Landlord may enter only with 24 hours’ notice except emergencies. No entry between 8 PM – 8 AM without consent.”* |\n| **Lead Paint Disclosure Acknowledgment** | Required by federal law | *“Tenant acknowledges receipt of EPA Lead-Based Paint Disclosure pamphlet dated [Date].”* (Already included — good!) |\n| **Pet Policy Clarity** | Avoids surprise denials | *“If pets allowed, specify species, breed, weight limit, number, and pet deposit/fee.”* |\n| **Smoking Policy Enforcement** | Prevents false accusations | *“Smoking prohibited inside or within 10 feet of structure. Violation subject to $[X] fine per incident.”* |\n\n---\n\n# 🧭 **IV. ACTIONABLE SUMMARY: WHAT TENANT SHOULD DO BEFORE SIGNING**\n\n✅ **1. Cross-reference ALL clauses with your STATE’S landlord-tenant law.**  \n→ Use resources like Nolo, State Attorney General websites, or local tenant unions.\n\n✅ **2. Negotiate and strike or amend the following key clauses:**\n- Non-refundable deposit portion\n- Mold waiver\n- Broad indemnification\n- Automatic deposit application to rent\n- Vague abandonment definition\n- No repair obligations for landlord\n- No timeline for deposit return\n\n✅ **3. Attach Exhibits:**\n- Move-in/move-out checklist with photos\n- House Rules (signed by both)\n- Lead Paint Disclosure (already there — keep!)\n- Pet Policy (if applicable)\n\n✅ **4. Get Legal Advice (Optional but Recommended):**\n- Especially if dealing with large deposit, long-term lease, or complex rules.\n\n✅ **5. Document Everything:**\n- Take video/photo tour at move-in and move-out.\n- Save all communication with landlord.\n- Keep receipts for repairs, cleaning, etc.\n\n✅ **6. Obtain Renter’s Insurance Immediately.**\n- Required by contract — protects tenant’s belongings and liability.\n\n---\n\n# 🏁 FINAL VERDICT:\n\n> **This lease is heavily skewed toward Landlord. While it covers basic elements, it contains numerous provisions that are legally questionable, overly broad, or outright unenforceable in many jurisdictions — especially regarding security deposits, liability waivers, and maintenance obligations.**\n\n> **As a Tenant, you are taking significant legal and financial risk by signing this as-is.**\n\n---\n\n# ✍️ **SUGGESTED REVISIONS TO INCLUDE IN NEGOTIATION**\n\nHere’s a concise list of **must-have edits** to protect Tenant:\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **ADD TO SECURITY DEPOSIT SECTION:**\n\n```text\n1. The entire security deposit is refundable, subject to lawful deductions for unpaid rent, damage beyond normal wear and tear, and excessive cleaning.\n2. Landlord shall return the deposit, less lawful deductions, within [X] days after Tenant vacates and provides forwarding address.\n3. Landlord shall provide an itemized statement of deductions with supporting documentation (receipts, photos, estimates). Failure to do so renders all deductions invalid.\n4. Landlord shall hold deposit in a separate, interest-bearing account at a federally insured bank.\n5. Normal wear and tear includes: minor scuffs, faded paint, worn carpet, general aging of fixtures. Damage beyond normal wear and tear requires proof of causation by Tenant.\n6. Tenant may request a pre-move-out walkthrough to address issues before departure.\n```\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **AMEND DEFAULT & TERMINATION CLAUSE:**\n\n```text\nTenant shall have 5 days to cure any default after written notice. No default shall be deemed incurable unless it materially threatens health, safety, or property integrity. Landlord may not terminate for third recurrence unless Tenant failed to cure despite prior opportunities.\n```\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **DELETE OR REVISE:**\n\n- “Non-refundable portion of deposit”\n- “Mold waiver”\n- “Landlord not liable for negligence” clause\n- “Deposit may be applied to rent at Landlord’s discretion”\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **ADD:**\n\n- Habitability warranty\n- Repair responsibility split\n- Quiet enjoyment clause\n- Mediation/arbitration preference\n- Clear pet policy (if applicable)\n- Rent increase limitation during month-to-month term\n\n---\n\n# 📌 CONCLUSION\n\nThis lease template is **not tenant-friendly** and contains multiple provisions that could expose the Tenant to **financial loss, legal liability, and eviction risk** without adequate recourse.\n\n**Do NOT sign without negotiation.**\n\nUse this review to **demand revisions** that align with your state’s laws and protect your rights. If landlord refuses to amend, consider walking away — there are better, fairer leases available.\n\n---\n\n📌 **Need help drafting revised clauses or negotiating with landlord? I can generate a redlined version or customized addendum tailored to your state. Just let me know!**\n\nLet me know if you’d like:\n- A printable checklist for Tenant to use before signing\n- A fully revised lease draft incorporating all protections\n- State-specific legal citations for your jurisdiction\n\nYou’ve got this — and now you’re armed with knowledge to negotiate confidently.\n\n---\n\n**Report Generated:** This analysis is based on maximizing the interests of Tenant in the House Rental industry.",

    "llm_output_test2": "result: # Contract Risk Review Report\n\n## Review Information\n- **Reviewing Party:** Recipient\n- **Industry/Work Field:** Confidentiality Agreement\n\n---\n\n## Analysis and Recommendations\n\nThank you for the comprehensive contract and detailed review framework. Below is a **thorough, risk-focused legal analysis** of the Confidential Disclosure Agreement (CDA) from the perspective of the **Recipient** — in this case, **[COMPANY NAME]** — with specific attention to **Duration of Confidentiality**, but also evaluating broader contractual risks and opportunities for optimization.\n\n---\n\n# 📄 **Comprehensive Contract Risk Review: Confidential Disclosure Agreement (CDA)**  \n**Reviewing Party:** Recipient ([COMPANY NAME])  \n**Contract Type:** Mutual NDA (Two-Way)  \n**Governing Law:** Massachusetts  \n**Key Counterparty:** President and Fellows of Harvard College (Harvard)\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 I. OVERALL CONTRACT STRUCTURE & RISK PROFILE\n\nThis is a **mutual, two-way CDA** where both parties may disclose confidential information. The structure is **balanced on its face**, but contains several provisions that **disproportionately favor Harvard**, particularly in duration, scope, and enforcement.\n\n### ✅ Strengths:\n- Clear definition of “Confidential Information” including oral disclosures if memorialized.\n- Reasonable exclusions (public domain, independent development, etc.).\n- Survival clause extends obligations beyond termination.\n- Return/destruction obligations are clearly defined.\n- Jurisdiction and governing law are specified (Massachusetts).\n\n### ⚠️ Major Risks for Recipient:\n1. **Unilateral Duration Terms** – Confidentiality survives 5 years post-effective date, regardless of when info was disclosed or whether it’s still sensitive.\n2. **No Trade Secret carve-out** – No distinction between general confidential info and true trade secrets; all info gets same 5-year term.\n3. **Overly Broad Definition of Confidential Information** – Includes anything “that would lead a reasonable person... to believe it should be treated as confidential,” which is subjective and expansive.\n4. **No Sunset for Harvard’s Obligations** – Harvard’s obligations are symmetrically bound — but Harvard is an academic institution with broad publication rights under Section 9.\n5. **Export Control Clause is One-Sided** – Only Company is restricted from sharing ITAR/EAR-controlled materials; no reciprocal obligation for Harvard.\n6. **No Right to Challenge Designation** – Recipient cannot dispute what is deemed “confidential” after disclosure.\n7. **No Limitation on Harvard’s Publication Rights** – Section 9 allows Harvard to publish results under a separate research agreement — potentially undermining confidentiality.\n\n---\n\n# 🕒 II. DETAILED ANALYSIS AGAINST “DURATION OF CONFIDENTIALITY” CHECKPOINTS\n\nWe now apply your 15-point checklist to evaluate the **Duration Clause (Section 8)** and related provisions.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ 1. Explicit Definition of Term\n\n> **Clause Reference**: Section 8: “The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and expire on the date that is two (2) years later… Receiving Party’s non-disclosure and non-use obligations… shall not expire until the date that is five (5) years after the Effective Date.”\n\n✔️ **Check**: Clearly defined — 2-year agreement term, 5-year survival of obligations.\n\n⚠️ **Risk**: The 5-year survival period applies to **all** Confidential Information received during the 2-year term — even if disclosed on Day 1 or Day 730. This creates a **rigid, inflexible term** that does not account for:\n- When the info was disclosed\n- Whether it became public earlier\n- Whether it lost commercial value\n\n👉 **Recommendation**: Amend to tie survival to **date of disclosure**, not Effective Date. Example:\n\n> “The Receiving Party’s obligations shall survive for five (5) years from the date of disclosure of each item of Confidential Information, or until such information becomes publicly known through no fault of the Receiving Party, whichever occurs first.”\n\n---\n\n## ✅ 2. Alignment with Applicable Law\n\n> **Governing Law**: Massachusetts (Section 10)\n\n✅ Massachusetts law generally enforces NDAs with reasonable terms. However:\n\n⚠️ **Risk**: Under Massachusetts law, indefinite confidentiality is unenforceable unless tied to true trade secrets (see *PepsiCo v. Redmond*, 54 F.3d 1262). Here, **no distinction is made** between trade secrets and other confidential info.\n\nAlso, California (if any employees or contractors are based there) has strict limits on non-competes and overbroad NDAs (e.g., *California Business & Professions Code § 16600*). While not directly applicable here, if Company has CA-based personnel accessing info, this could create compliance issues.\n\n👉 **Recommendation**: Add a **trade secret carve-out**:\n\n> “Information that qualifies as a ‘trade secret’ under applicable law (including the Uniform Trade Secrets Act) shall be protected indefinitely, provided that the Disclosing Party takes reasonable measures to maintain secrecy.”\n\n---\n\n## ✅ 3. Differentiation Between Types of Information\n\n> **Clause Reference**: Section 2 defines “Confidential Information” broadly, without tiers.\n\n❌ **Check**: No differentiation. All info — technical specs, business plans, preliminary data — gets same 5-year protection.\n\n⚠️ **Risk**: Over-protection of low-sensitivity info increases compliance burden and litigation risk. Also, may deter collaboration if Recipient feels overly constrained.\n\n👉 **Recommendation**: Introduce **tiered confidentiality levels**:\n\n| Level | Description | Duration |\n|-------|-------------|----------|\n| Tier 1 (Trade Secret) | Patent-pending tech, formulas, algorithms | Indefinite (until loss of secrecy) |\n| Tier 2 (Highly Sensitive) | Financial models, unreleased product roadmaps | 5 years |\n| Tier 3 (General) | Meeting notes, non-core data | 2 years |\n\nAdd mechanism for Disclosing Party to label tier at time of disclosure.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ 4. Survival Clause Integration\n\n> **Clause Reference**: Section 8 explicitly states obligations survive 5 years post-agreement.\n\n✔️ **Check**: Survival clause is present and clear.\n\n⚠️ **Risk**: It is **not linked to the actual disclosure date**, creating potential for protecting stale or obsolete info.\n\n👉 **Recommendation**: Tie survival to **disclosure date**, not Effective Date. See above.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ 5. Event-Based Triggers for Expiration\n\n> **Clause Reference**: Section 2 lists exclusions (public domain, independent development, etc.).\n\n✔️ **Check**: Yes — includes standard exceptions.\n\n⚠️ **Risk**: No mechanism for **Recipient to notify Disclosing Party** that info has become public or is no longer confidential. No process for mutual release.\n\n👉 **Recommendation**: Add:\n\n> “If the Receiving Party reasonably believes that any Confidential Information has entered the public domain or otherwise falls outside the scope of this Agreement, it may provide written notice to the Disclosing Party requesting confirmation or release. If the Disclosing Party does not object within 30 days, such information shall be deemed no longer Confidential.”\n\n---\n\n## ✅ 6. Post-Term Obligations & Return/Destruction\n\n> **Clause Reference**: Section 8 requires return or destruction upon termination or request.\n\n✔️ **Check**: Clear instructions.\n\n⚠️ **Risk**: Allows Recipient to retain **one copy for compliance monitoring** — but doesn’t specify how long or under what security controls.\n\nAlso, **no certification of destruction** required.\n\n👉 **Recommendation**:\n- Require **written certification** of destruction/return.\n- Specify **retention period** for the one retained copy (e.g., “for no more than 1 year post-termination”).\n- Include **electronic media** (cloud, backups, emails) in destruction scope.\n\nExample:\n\n> “Upon termination or written request, the Receiving Party shall destroy or return all Confidential Information, including electronic copies, and provide written certification of such destruction within 15 days. The Receiving Party may retain one archival copy solely for compliance purposes, which shall be stored securely and destroyed within one (1) year.”\n\n---\n\n## ✅ 7. Jurisdictional Variance & Conflict of Laws\n\n> **Clause Reference**: Section 10 — governed by Massachusetts law; exclusive jurisdiction in MA courts.\n\n✔️ **Check**: Clear.\n\n⚠️ **Risk**: If Company is headquartered elsewhere (e.g., California, EU), enforcing MA law may be burdensome or subject to local consumer/protection laws.\n\nAlso, **no carve-out for GDPR or other data privacy regimes** if personal data is shared.\n\n👉 **Recommendation**:\n- Add **data privacy clause** if personal data may be exchanged.\n- Consider adding **choice of forum clause** allowing arbitration or alternative venue if practical.\n\nExample:\n\n> “If Confidential Information includes personal data subject to GDPR or other data protection laws, the parties agree to comply with such laws and may designate a mutually acceptable data processing agreement.”\n\n---\n\n## ✅ 8. Renewal or Extension Mechanisms\n\n> **Clause Reference**: Section 8 allows early termination with 30-day notice.\n\n❌ **Check**: No provision for **extension** of confidentiality term.\n\n⚠️ **Risk**: If parties enter into a Research Agreement later, the 5-year term may expire before project completion — leaving future disclosures unprotected.\n\n👉 **Recommendation**: Add:\n\n> “The parties may, by mutual written agreement, extend the confidentiality obligations beyond the five (5) year term for specific items of Confidential Information, provided such extension is documented in writing and signed by authorized representatives.”\n\n---\n\n## ✅ 9. Impact on Business Operations & Third Parties\n\n> **Clause Reference**: Section 3 allows disclosure to internal personnel with need-to-know and confidentiality agreements.\n\n✔️ **Check**: Reasonable.\n\n⚠️ **Risk**: No limit on **subcontractors or affiliates**. If Company uses third-party vendors (e.g., cloud providers, consultants), they may not be bound unless separately contracted.\n\nAlso, **no requirement for Harvard to bind its researchers** under same terms — which could create leakage points.\n\n👉 **Recommendation**:\n- Require **third-party recipients** to sign equivalent NDAs.\n- Add:\n\n> “The Receiving Party shall ensure that any third party to whom Confidential Information is disclosed complies with obligations no less restrictive than those herein.”\n\n---\n\n## ✅ 10. Remedies & Enforcement Clauses\n\n> **Clause Reference**: None explicitly stated.\n\n❌ **Check**: **Missing entirely**.\n\n⚠️ **Risk**: No mention of injunctive relief, damages, attorney fees, or liquidated damages. Leaves Recipient vulnerable if Harvard breaches — and no recourse if Harvard sues for breach.\n\nAlso, **no statute of limitations** specified for enforcement.\n\n👉 **Recommendation**: Add:\n\n> “The parties acknowledge that monetary damages may be inadequate for breach of this Agreement, and the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief without posting bond. The prevailing party in any action arising from this Agreement shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.”\n\n> “Any claim arising under this Agreement must be brought within two (2) years of the alleged breach.”\n\n---\n\n## ✅ 11. Clarity of Language & Ambiguity Avoidance\n\n> **Clause Reference**: Section 2 uses “reasonable person” standard.\n\n⚠️ **Risk**: “Nature of the information or circumstances… would lead a reasonable person… to believe it should be treated as confidential” is **highly subjective** and open to interpretation.\n\nThis could lead to disputes over whether something was “confidential” even if not marked.\n\n👉 **Recommendation**: Replace with objective criteria:\n\n> “Confidential Information shall be deemed to include only information that is either (a) marked ‘Confidential’ at the time of disclosure, or (b) orally disclosed and summarized in writing and marked ‘Confidential’ within 30 days, or (c) clearly identified in writing as confidential prior to disclosure.”\n\nRemove “reasonable person” standard unless necessary for trade secrets.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ 12. Industry-Specific Considerations\n\n> **Industry**: Tech/Biotech/Research Collaboration (given OTD and Researcher involvement)\n\n✅ **Check**: Standard for academia-industry partnerships.\n\n⚠️ **Risk**: In biotech/pharma, **clinical trial data or pre-publication research** may need longer protection than 5 years — especially if patent filing is pending.\n\nAlso, **Harvard’s right to publish** under Section 9 could override confidentiality if not carefully managed.\n\n👉 **Recommendation**:\n- Add **pre-publication review clause**:\n\n> “Prior to any publication, presentation, or disclosure of research results involving Confidential Information, the disclosing party shall provide the other party with a draft at least 30 days in advance to allow for redaction of Confidential Information.”\n\n- For biotech: Allow extension for patent-related info.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ 13. Benchmarking Against Industry Standards\n\n> **Standard NDA Duration**: 2–5 years for most commercial NDAs; indefinite for trade secrets.\n\n✅ This agreement is **within range** (5 years survival).\n\n⚠️ **But**: Most industry-standard NDAs tie duration to **disclosure date**, not effective date. Also, many include **tiered durations**.\n\n👉 **Recommendation**: Align with market norms by adopting **disclosure-date-based survival** and **tiered protection**.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ 14. Risk Assessment & Negotiation Leverage\n\n> **Sensitivity of Info**: Likely high — given OTD involvement and research context.\n\n⚠️ **Risk**: Harvard has **publication rights** (Section 9) and **academic freedom** — which may conflict with confidentiality.\n\nAlso, Harvard is likely to push for long-term protection — but Recipient should negotiate for **flexibility**.\n\n👉 **Negotiation Strategy**:\n- Push for **shorter survival period** (3–4 years instead of 5).\n- Demand **tiered confidentiality**.\n- Insist on **pre-publication review**.\n- Request **mutual export control obligations** (currently only on Company).\n\n---\n\n## ✅ 15. Documentation & Audit Trail\n\n> **Clause Reference**: Section 2 requires marking of info; Section 8 allows retention of one copy.\n\n⚠️ **Risk**: No requirement to **log disclosures**, track access, or audit compliance.\n\n👉 **Recommendation**: Add:\n\n> “Each party shall maintain a log of all Confidential Information disclosed, including date, recipient, and classification. Upon request, either party may audit compliance with this Agreement, with reasonable notice and at the requesting party’s expense.”\n\n---\n\n# 🚨 III. ADDITIONAL RISKS BEYOND DURATION CLAUSE\n\n## A. **One-Sided Export Control Clause**\n\n> **Clause Reference**: Section 2: “Company shall not share with Harvard any information… subject to ITAR or EAR.”\n\n⚠️ **Risk**: Only Company is restricted. Harvard can disclose U.S.-controlled tech without restriction? Unlikely — but the clause implies asymmetry.\n\n👉 **Recommendation**: Make it mutual:\n\n> “Neither party shall disclose any information subject to ITAR or EAR without prior written consent of the other party and compliance with applicable regulations.”\n\n---\n\n## B. **No Mutual Non-Use Restriction Beyond Purpose**\n\n> **Clause Reference**: Section 5 — use limited to “Purpose”\n\n⚠️ **Risk**: Purpose is vaguely defined as “evaluating possibility of entering into research or licensing relationship.” What if Harvard uses info to develop competing tech?\n\n👉 **Recommendation**: Clarify “Purpose” and add:\n\n> “The Purpose shall be limited to evaluation of potential collaboration and shall not include independent development, commercialization, or competitive analysis.”\n\n---\n\n## C. **No Liability Cap or Indemnification**\n\n> **Clause Reference**: None.\n\n⚠️ **Risk**: If Recipient inadvertently discloses info, Harvard could sue for unlimited damages.\n\n👉 **Recommendation**: Add mutual indemnification and liability cap:\n\n> “Neither party shall be liable for indirect, consequential, or punitive damages arising from this Agreement. Each party agrees to indemnify the other for losses resulting from its own breach.”\n\n---\n\n## D. **No Force Majeure or Termination for Convenience**\n\n> **Clause Reference**: Only 30-day termination notice.\n\n⚠️ **Risk**: No flexibility for unforeseen events (e.g., pandemic, regulatory change).\n\n👉 **Recommendation**: Add:\n\n> “Either party may terminate this Agreement for convenience with 30 days’ notice. Either party may terminate immediately for material breach or force majeure event.”\n\n---\n\n# ✍️ IV. RECOMMENDED REVISIONS SUMMARY (FOR RECIPIENT)\n\nBelow is a **prioritized list of changes** to maximize Recipient’s protection:\n\n---\n\n## 🔝 **Top 5 Critical Revisions**\n\n1. **Change Duration to Be Tied to Disclosure Date**  \n   > “Obligations survive 5 years from date of disclosure, or until public domain, whichever is sooner.”\n\n2. **Add Tiered Confidentiality Levels**  \n   > Define Trade Secret, High Sensitivity, General — with different durations.\n\n3. **Require Pre-Publication Review for Harvard**  \n   > “Harvard shall provide draft publications 30 days in advance for redaction.”\n\n4. **Mutualize Export Control Restrictions**  \n   > “Neither party shall disclose ITAR/EAR-controlled info without consent.”\n\n5. **Add Remedies Clause + Attorney Fees**  \n   > “Prevailing party recovers fees; statute of limitations = 2 years.”\n\n---\n\n## 📌 Additional Recommended Clauses\n\n- **Definition of “Purpose”** – Narrow and specific.\n- **Audit Rights** – For compliance verification.\n- **Certification of Destruction** – Required upon return.\n- **Data Privacy Addendum** – If personal data involved.\n- **Severability Clause** – To preserve enforceability.\n- **Arbitration Option** – For dispute resolution (optional).\n\n---\n\n# 📊 V. FINAL RISK ASSESSMENT MATRIX\n\n| Risk Area | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation Status | Recommendation |\n|-----------|----------|------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| Duration Too Long & Rigid | High | High | Poor | Revise to disclosure-date-based |\n| No Trade Secret Distinction | Medium | Medium | Poor | Add tiered system |\n| Harvard’s Publication Rights | High | Medium | Poor | Add pre-review clause |\n| One-Sided Export Controls | Medium | Low | Poor | Mutualize restriction |\n| No Remedies Clause | High | Medium | Poor | Add injunctive relief + fees |\n| Ambiguous “Reasonable Person” Test | Medium | High | Poor | Replace with objective criteria |\n| No Certification of Destruction | Low | High | Fair | Add written certification |\n\n---\n\n# ✅ VI. CONCLUSION & NEXT STEPS\n\nThis CDA is **legally sound but heavily skewed toward Harvard’s interests**, particularly in duration, scope, and enforcement. As the **Recipient**, [COMPANY NAME] faces significant compliance, operational, and litigation risks if accepted as-is.\n\n### 🎯 Strategic Recommendations:\n\n1. **Negotiate the 5-year survival term** down to 3–4 years, or tie it to disclosure date.\n2. **Insist on tiered confidentiality** to avoid over-protection of low-value info.\n3. **Demand pre-publication review rights** to protect against premature disclosure.\n4. **Mutualize all restrictions** — especially export controls and publication rights.\n5. **Add remedies, audit rights, and destruction certification** to ensure enforceability and accountability.\n\n### 📤 Next Steps:\n\n- Draft revised version incorporating above changes.\n- Submit to Harvard OTD with cover letter explaining rationale.\n- Offer compromise: e.g., 4-year term + tiered protection + pre-review.\n- If Harvard refuses, consider limiting disclosures or using a unilateral NDA instead.\n\n---\n\n# 📥 APPENDIX: SAMPLE REVISED CLAUSES\n\n### ➤ Revised Section 8 (Duration & Return):\n\n> “The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and expire two (2) years thereafter. The Receiving Party’s obligations of non-disclosure and non-use shall survive for five (5) years from the date of disclosure of each item of Confidential Information, or until such information becomes publicly known through no fault of the Receiving Party, whichever occurs first. Upon termination or written request, the Receiving Party shall promptly return or destroy all Confidential Information and provide written certification of such destruction within fifteen (15) days. The Receiving Party may retain one archival copy solely for compliance purposes, which shall be destroyed within one (1) year.”\n\n---\n\n### ➤ Added Section: Tiered Confidentiality\n\n> “Confidential Information shall be classified as follows: (i) ‘Trade Secret’ — information qualifying as such under applicable law, protected indefinitely; (ii) ‘Highly Confidential’ — technical, financial, or strategic data, protected for five (5) years; (iii) ‘General Confidential’ — meeting notes, non-core data, protected for two (2) years. Classification shall be designated in writing at time of disclosure.”\n\n---\n\n### ➤ Added Section: Publication Review\n\n> “Prior to any public disclosure, publication, or presentation of research results involving Confidential Information, the disclosing party shall provide the other party with a draft at least thirty (30) days in advance to allow for redaction of Confidential Information.”\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you’d like this formatted into a tracked-changes Word doc, negotiation script, or comparison table against Harvard’s original. I’m happy to assist further.\n\n--- \n\n✅ **Final Verdict**: **Do NOT sign as-is. Negotiate key terms to protect Recipient’s operational flexibility, reduce compliance burden, and align with industry standards.**\n\n---\n\n**Report Generated:** This analysis is based on maximizing the interests of Recipient in the Confidentiality Agreement industry.",

As **counsel for the Sponsor (Johnson & Johnson Foundation Inc.)**, I will conduct a **thorough risk analysis** of this **Foundation Sponsorship Agreement**, with special focus on **Force Majeure refund protections** and **exclusivity against direct competitors** — two critical areas in brand marketing and sponsorship.\n\n---\n\n# 🧾 COMPREHENSIVE CONTRACT RISK REVIEW  \n## FOR JOHNSON & JOHNSON FOUNDATION INC. — SPONSOR\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 I. OVERALL CONTRACT STRUCTURE & KEY GAPS\n\n### ✅ Strengths:\n- Clear structure with numbered sections.\n- Survival clauses for key provisions (Sections 4–18).\n- Mutual indemnification, confidentiality, force majeure, and arbitration clauses are present.\n- Strong IP licensing terms with approval rights and ownership safeguards.\n- Explicit “No Endorsement” and “No Political Activity” clauses — critical for reputational protection.\n\n### ❗ Major Weaknesses:\n1. **No explicit Force Majeure refund mechanism** — only免责 (excuse from performance), not financial remedy.\n2. **Exclusivity clause is fatally weak** — Section 9 explicitly *permits* Recipient to sponsor competitors.\n3. **No liquidated damages or audit rights** for breach of exclusivity or non-compliance.\n4. **No defined process for refund claims or documentation requirements** under Force Majeure.\n5. **No post-event restrictions on competitor sponsorship** — risks dilution of value immediately after event.\n\n---\n\n# ⚠️ II. DETAILED ANALYSIS AGAINST REVIEW CHECKPOINTS\n\n---\n\n## 🧭 I. FORCE MAJEURE & REFUND POLICY CHECKPOINTS\n\n### 1. Definition & Scope of Force Majeure\n✅ **Present**: Section 15 defines Force Majeure broadly: “acts or events beyond reasonable control,” including acts of God, terrorism, war, strikes, fires, etc.\n\n❌ **Missing**: \n- No mention of **pandemics**, **government-mandated closures**, or **venue cancellations** — highly relevant in post-COVID era.\n- No reference to **industry-specific disruptions** (e.g., cancellation of medical conferences due to regulatory changes).\n\n> **Recommendation**: Amend Section 15 to include:\n> > “including but not limited to: pandemic-related public health orders, government-mandated event cancellations, venue unavailability due to force majeure, or material reduction in attendance exceeding 50%.”\n\n---\n\n### 2. Triggering Conditions for Refund Eligibility\n❌ **Absent**: No linkage between Force Majeure and refund obligations. The clause only excuses performance — **no financial remedy**.\n\n> **Risk**: If event is canceled due to pandemic, Sponsor pays full amount but receives no benefit → **significant financial loss**.\n\n> **Recommendation**: Add new subsection to Section 15:\n> > “In the event of a Force Majeure Event that results in cancellation or material curtailment (defined as >50% reduction in scheduled activities or attendance) of the Conference/Event, Sponsor shall be entitled to a pro-rata refund of unused sponsorship funds, calculated based on the portion of the event not delivered.”\n\n---\n\n### 3. Refund Amount & Calculation Methodology\n❌ **Not addressed**. No formula, tiered structure, or exclusion of sunk costs.\n\n> **Risk**: Ambiguity leads to disputes. Recipient may argue “all funds were spent on prep” even if event didn’t occur.\n\n> **Recommendation**: Insert detailed refund schedule:\n> > “Refund amounts shall be calculated as follows:\n> > - If cancellation occurs >90 days prior: 100% refund\n> > - 60–89 days prior: 75% refund\n> > - 30–59 days prior: 50% refund\n> > - <30 days prior: 25% refund\n> > Sunk costs (e.g., deposits, design fees) must be itemized and approved by Sponsor in advance to be excluded from refund.”\n\n---\n\n### 4. Timing & Process for Refund Request & Disbursement\n❌ **No process defined**. No deadline, documentation, or timeline for disbursement.\n\n> **Risk**: Delayed or denied refunds; no recourse without litigation.\n\n> **Recommendation**: Add:\n> > “Recipient shall notify Sponsor within 5 business days of Force Majeure event occurrence. Within 10 business days, Recipient shall submit written notice of cancellation, supporting documentation (e.g., official closure order, insurance denial letter), and proposed refund calculation. Sponsor shall approve or dispute within 5 business days. Approved refunds shall be disbursed within 15 business days.”\n\n---\n\n### 5. Alternative Remedies vs. Refund\n❌ **No alternatives offered**. No option for rescheduling, credit, or media replacement.\n\n> **Risk**: Sponsor loses all value if event is canceled — no fallback.\n\n> **Recommendation**: Add:\n> > “Sponsor may, at its sole discretion, elect to apply unused funds toward a rescheduled event, future sponsorship, or equivalent media exposure package. If Sponsor does not elect an alternative within 30 days, full refund shall be issued.”\n\n---\n\n### 6. Exclusions & Limitations\n❌ **No carve-outs or limitations defined**. No mention of economic downturns or market volatility — which could be abused.\n\n> **Risk**: Recipient may claim “market conditions” as Force Majeure to avoid delivering value.\n\n> **Recommendation**: Add:\n> > “Force Majeure shall not include: (i) general economic downturns, (ii) market volatility, (iii) failure to secure permits due to negligence, or (iv) Sponsor’s own failure to perform.”\n\n---\n\n### 7. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution\n✅ **Present**: Arbitration in New Jersey under AAA rules; choice of law = NJ substantive law; FAA governs arbitration clause.\n\n⚠️ **Concern**: No fast-track mechanism for urgent refund disputes. No right to suspend payments pending resolution.\n\n> **Recommendation**: Add:\n> > “In the event of dispute over Force Majeure refund eligibility, Sponsor may suspend further payments until resolution. Arbitration shall be expedited, with hearing to occur within 30 days of demand.”\n\n---\n\n## 🚫 II. EXCLUSIVITY PROVISIONS CHECKPOINTS (COMPETITOR SPONSORSHIP BAN)\n\n### 1. Definition of “Direct Competitor”\n❌ **Completely absent**. Section 9 says: “Recipient shall have the right to contract with other corporate sponsors in competing industries…”\n\n> **Catastrophic Risk**: This clause **explicitly permits** Recipient to accept sponsorship from direct competitors (e.g., Pfizer, Merck, Novartis) — directly undermining J&J’s brand equity and ROI.\n\n> **Recommendation**: **DELETE SECTION 9 ENTIRELY** and replace with:\n> > “During the Term and for 12 months thereafter, Recipient shall not accept sponsorship, co-branding, or promotional support from any entity that competes with Sponsor in the pharmaceutical, medical device, consumer health, or healthcare services sectors, as defined in Exhibit C (Competitor Matrix).”\n\n> ➤ **Attach Exhibit C** listing prohibited brands/categories (e.g., “Pfizer, Merck, Roche, Novartis, Abbott, GSK, Sanofi, AstraZeneca, etc.”).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Scope of Exclusivity\n❌ **No scope defined**. No mention of digital, broadcast, merchandise, or ancillary activations.\n\n> **Risk**: Competitor logos appear on social media, streaming feeds, or event apps — diluting J&J’s visibility.\n\n> **Recommendation**: Add:\n> > “Exclusivity applies to all physical, digital, broadcast, and promotional materials related to the Conference/Event, including but not limited to: signage, websites, mobile apps, email campaigns, social media, video content, merchandise, and live-streamed sessions.”\n\n---\n\n### 3. Duration & Territory\n❌ **No duration or territory specified**. Exclusivity ends with agreement — no post-event protection.\n\n> **Risk**: Competitor sponsors next year’s event — immediate devaluation of J&J’s investment.\n\n> **Recommendation**: Add:\n> > “Exclusivity shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement for a period of 12 months following the last day of the Conference/Event.”\n\n---\n\n### 4. Enforcement Mechanisms\n❌ **No audit, removal, or termination rights**.\n\n> **Risk**: No way to verify compliance or enforce removal of unauthorized branding.\n\n> **Recommendation**: Add:\n> > “Sponsor shall have the right to inspect all promotional materials, digital assets, and event spaces for compliance with exclusivity. Upon discovery of unauthorized competitor branding, Recipient shall remove such branding within 24 hours at its own expense. Failure to comply shall constitute material breach, entitling Sponsor to terminate and seek refund + liquidated damages.”\n\n---\n\n### 5. Penalties & Remedies for Breach\n❌ **No penalties, damages, or termination rights**.\n\n> **Risk**: No deterrent for Recipient to violate exclusivity.\n\n> **Recommendation**: Add:\n> > “Breach of exclusivity shall entitle Sponsor to: (a) immediate termination of Agreement, (b) full refund of unused sponsorship funds, and (c) liquidated damages equal to 150% of the sponsorship amount, representing lost brand value and opportunity cost.”\n\n---\n\n### 6. Right to Approve Co-Sponsors or Partners\n❌ **No approval rights**. Recipient can freely add partners.\n\n> **Risk**: Competitor sneaks in via “non-sponsor” partnership (e.g., “official wellness partner”).\n\n> **Recommendation**: Add:\n> > “Recipient shall obtain Sponsor’s prior written approval for any co-sponsorship, partnership, or promotional collaboration involving third parties. Approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, but Sponsor may reject any entity falling within the Competitor Matrix (Exhibit C).”\n\n---\n\n### 7. Post-Termination Restrictions\n❌ **None**.\n\n> **Risk**: Recipient accepts competitor sponsorship immediately after event.\n\n> **Recommendation**: Already covered above — add 12-month survival clause.\n\n---\n\n### 8. Monitoring & Reporting Obligations\n❌ **No disclosure or notification requirements**.\n\n> **Risk**: Sponsor learns of competitor sponsorship too late.\n\n> **Recommendation**: Add:\n> > “Recipient shall disclose all current and prospective sponsorships to Sponsor quarterly. Any expression of interest from a direct competitor shall be disclosed to Sponsor within 48 hours.”\n\n---\n\n## 📋 III. CROSS-CUTTING PROVISIONS TO REINFORCE RIGHTS\n\n### 1. Representations & Warranties\n✅ Section 3(a)(ii) and 3(b)(ii) contain IP warranties — good.\n\n❌ **Missing**: Warranty that Recipient has authority to grant exclusivity and has no conflicting agreements.\n\n> **Recommendation**: Add:\n> > “Recipient warrants that it has not entered into, and will not enter into, any agreement that conflicts with the exclusivity granted herein.”\n\n---\n\n### 2. Indemnification\n✅ Section 11 provides mutual indemnification — standard.\n\n❌ **Missing**: Specific indemnity for breach of exclusivity or failure to refund under Force Majeure.\n\n> **Recommendation**: Amend Section 11 to include:\n> > “Indemnitor shall indemnify Indemnitee for any losses, including lost opportunity costs, reputational harm, and legal fees, arising from: (d) breach of exclusivity obligations; (e) failure to refund funds under Force Majeure; or (f) unauthorized use of Sponsor Marks.”\n\n---\n\n### 3. Survival Clauses\n✅ Section 1 survives for many provisions — good.\n\n❌ **Missing**: Explicit survival of exclusivity and refund rights.\n\n> **Recommendation**: Add to Section 1:\n> > “Sections 3 (Licenses), 4 (No Endorsement), 5 (Compliance), 6 (Transparency), 9 (Exclusivity — if revised), 11 (Indemnification), 15 (Force Majeure — if amended), and 18 (Notice) shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement.”\n\n---\n\n### 4. Notice Provisions\n✅ Section 18 covers notice delivery — adequate.\n\n> **Recommendation**: Add email as acceptable method for urgent matters (e.g., Force Majeure notice):\n> > “For purposes of Force Majeure or exclusivity breach notices, email to designated contacts shall be deemed effective upon transmission.”\n\n---\n\n### 5. Entire Agreement & Amendment\n✅ Section 19 — good.\n\n> **Recommendation**: Strengthen:\n> > “This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties. No oral modifications or side agreements shall be binding unless in writing signed by both parties.”\n\n---\n\n### 6. Liquidated Damages Clause\n❌ **Absent**.\n\n> **Risk**: No pre-agreed damages for breach — costly litigation to prove harm.\n\n> **Recommendation**: Add:\n> > “The parties agree that actual damages for breach of exclusivity or failure to refund under Force Majeure would be difficult to quantify. Therefore, liquidated damages of 150% of the sponsorship amount shall be payable by Recipient upon breach.”\n\n---\n\n### 7. Audit & Inspection Rights\n❌ **Absent**.\n\n> **Risk**: No ability to verify compliance with exclusivity or refund calculations.\n\n> **Recommendation**: Add:\n> > “Sponsor shall have the right, upon 10 days’ notice, to audit Recipient’s records related to sponsorship fulfillment, competitor sponsorships, and refund calculations. Costs of audit shall be borne by Recipient if discrepancies exceed 5%.”\n\n---\n\n## 📌 IV. RECOMMENDED ADDENDUMS OR ATTACHMENTS\n\n| Addendum | Purpose |\n|----------|---------|\n| **Exhibit C – Competitor Matrix** | List of prohibited brands/categories (e.g., Pfizer, Merck, etc.) |\n| **Exhibit D – Force Majeure Event Log Template** | Standard form for documenting qualifying events |\n| **Exhibit E – Refund Calculation Worksheet** | Pre-agreed formula for pro-rata refunds |\n| **Exhibit F – Competitor Approval Form** | Required for any new partner outside exclusivity scope |\n\n---\n\n# ✅ FINAL REVIEW SUMMARY & ACTION PLAN\n\n> ✔️ **Urgent Action Required**: Delete Section 9 and replace with strong exclusivity clause.  \n> ✔️ **Critical Addition**: Insert Force Majeure refund mechanism with clear triggers, calculation, and process.  \n> ✔️ **Strongly Recommended**: Add liquidated damages, audit rights, and survival clauses.  \n> ✔️ **Best Practice**: Attach Exhibits C–F to operationalize key terms.\n\n---\n\n## 🛡️ TOP 5 RISKS TO MITIGATE IMMEDIATELY\n\n| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |\n|------|--------|------------|\n| **1. No refund for canceled events** | High financial loss | Add Force Majeure refund clause with tiered schedule |\n| **2. Competitors allowed to sponsor** | Severe brand dilution | Delete Section 9; insert strict exclusivity with Competitor Matrix |\n| **3. No enforcement mechanisms** | Unenforceable rights | Add audit, removal, termination, and liquidated damages rights |\n| **4. No post-event protection** | Immediate devaluation | Add 12-month survival of exclusivity |\n| **5. No defined process for disputes** | Delays, uncertainty | Add expedited arbitration and payment suspension rights |\n\n---\n\n## ✍️ NEGOTIATION STRATEGY FOR SPONSOR\n\n1. **Lead with exclusivity**: “We cannot proceed without exclusivity. Section 9 must be deleted and replaced.”\n2. **Frame refund as fairness**: “If the event doesn’t happen, we shouldn’t pay full price. Let’s agree on a fair refund schedule.”\n3. **Use industry precedent**: “Major sponsors like Pfizer and Merck require these protections. We’re aligning with best practices.”\n4. **Offer flexibility**: “We’re open to reasonable alternatives — but not at the cost of our brand equity or financial protection.”\n5. **Threaten walkaway**: “Without these changes, we’ll need to reconsider our sponsorship.”\n\n---\n\n## 📄 REDLINE TEMPLATE SUGGESTIONS (KEY CHANGES)\n\n```diff\n- 9. No Exclusivity. During the term of this Agreement, Recipient shall have the right to contract with other corporate sponsors in competing industries...\n+ 9. Exclusivity. During the Term and for 12 months thereafter, Recipient shall not accept sponsorship, co-branding, or promotional support from any entity listed in Exhibit C (Competitor Matrix). Sponsor shall have veto rights over any new partners.\n```\n\n```diff\n+ 15.1 Refund for Force Majeure. In the event of a Force Majeure Event resulting in cancellation or material curtailment (>50% reduction in activities/attendance), Sponsor shall be entitled to a pro-rata refund as set forth in Exhibit E.\n```\n\n```diff\n+ 11.4 Indemnification for Breach. Recipient shall indemnify Sponsor for losses arising from breach of exclusivity or failure to refund under Force Majeure.\n```\n\n---\n\n# 🏁 CONCLUSION\n\nThis contract, in its current form, **poses unacceptable financial and reputational risks to Johnson & Johnson Foundation Inc.** The lack of exclusivity and refund protections fundamentally undermines the value of the sponsorship. \n\n**With the recommended amendments**, this agreement can become a **strong, enforceable, and mutually beneficial partnership** that protects J&J’s brand, ensures ROI, and aligns with industry standards.\n\n---\n\n✅ **Next Steps**:\n1. Draft redlined version incorporating all recommendations.\n2. Attach Exhibits C–F.\n3. Submit to Recipient with negotiation points prioritized.\n4. Prepare fallback positions (e.g., reduced sponsorship amount if exclusivity not granted).\n\nLet me know if you’d like me to generate the **redlined contract**, **negotiation script**, or **executive summary for internal stakeholders**.\n\n--- \n\n**Final Note**: In brand marketing sponsorships, **exclusivity and refund rights are non-negotiable**. Protecting them is not just legal diligence — it’s strategic brand management.\n\n---\n\n**Report Generated:** This analysis is based on maximizing the interests of Sponsor in the Brand Marketing & Sponsorship industry."

    "llm_output_test3": "output: 【深度解析】注意力机制：让AI学会“聚焦重点”的核心黑科技\n\n文 / 菜鸟教程 · AI技术专栏  \n配图建议：Transformer架构示意图 + 注意力权重热力图\n\n—\n\n🌟 引言：为什么AI也需要“注意力”？\n\n你有没有想过——当你阅读一篇文章时，大脑是如何自动锁定关键词、忽略冗余信息的？这种“选择性关注”的能力，正是人类认知效率的核心。\n\n在深度学习领域，**注意力机制（Attention Mechanism）** 正是模仿这一机制而诞生的关键技术。它让神经网络不再“一视同仁”，而是能像人一样，**动态分配资源，聚焦最相关的信息**。\n\n从2017年《Attention Is All You Need》横空出世，到如今BERT、GPT、LLaMA等大模型统治NLP世界，注意力机制早已成为现代AI系统的“心脏”。\n\n今天，我们就来系统拆解这个改变AI格局的技术——从原理、实现、应用到进阶方向，一篇讲透！\n\n—\n\n📌 一、什么是注意力机制？——不止是“加权平均”\n\n简单来说，注意力机制是一种**根据上下文动态计算权重**的方法，用于决定输入数据中哪些部分对当前任务更重要。\n\n✅ 核心思想：\n> “不是所有输入都同等重要，我要根据当前需求，给每个部分打分，然后按分值加权。”\n\n数学表达式如下：\n\n```\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √d_k) × V\n```\n\n其中：\n- **Q (Query)**：当前需要输出的“问题”或“目标”\n- **K (Key)**：输入序列中每个元素的“标识符”\n- **V (Value)**：与Key对应的“实际内容”\n- **d_k**：Key的维度，用于缩放点积结果，防止梯度爆炸\n\n💡 类比理解：\n想象你在翻译句子：“The cat sat on the mat.”  \n当生成法语单词“chat”时，模型会“注意”英文中的“cat”，而不是“the”或“on”。这就是注意力机制在起作用。\n\n—\n\n🚀 二、为什么必须用注意力机制？三大革命性优势\n\n1️⃣ 解决长距离依赖问题  \n传统RNN（如LSTM）在处理长文本时容易“遗忘”前面的信息，而注意力机制允许任意位置直接交互，**无视距离限制**。\n\n2️⃣ 支持并行计算  \nRNN必须按顺序处理，而注意力机制可同时计算所有位置的关系，**大幅提升训练速度**。\n\n3️⃣ 增强可解释性  \n注意力权重可视化后，我们可以直观看到模型“关注了哪里”，这对调试和信任模型至关重要。\n\n—\n\n🧠 三、自注意力机制（Self-Attention）：Transformer的基石\n\n这是注意力机制中最重要的一种变体——**每个词都可以关注序列中所有其他词**。\n\n🔹 工作流程：\n1. 对每个词，计算其与其他所有词的相似度得分（通过Q×K^T）\n2. 使用softmax归一化为概率分布（即注意力权重）\n3. 用这些权重对Value加权求和，得到该位置的新表示\n\n🎯 示例代码（PyTorch简化版）：\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef self_attention(query, key, value):\n    scores = torch.matmul(query, key.transpose(-2, -1)) / (query.size(-1) ** 0.5)\n    weights = F.softmax(scores, dim=-1)\n    return torch.matmul(weights, value)\n```\n\n✅ 自注意力的优势：\n- 全局上下文感知：每个位置都能“看到”整个句子\n- 位置无关性：不依赖序列顺序，适合结构化数据\n- 高效并行：计算复杂度虽为O(n²)，但GPU加速效果显著\n\n—\n\n🔗 四、多头注意力（Multi-Head Attention）：让模型“多视角思考”\n\n单头注意力就像用一个摄像头观察世界，而多头注意力则是**多个摄像头同时从不同角度拍摄**，再融合结果。\n\n🔹 结构组成：\n- 多个并行的注意力头（通常8个）\n- 每个头独立学习不同的关系模式\n- 最终将各头输出拼接，并通过线性层整合\n\n🎯 实现示例（PyTorch类封装）：\n\n```python\nclass MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, d_model, num_heads):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.d_model = d_model\n        self.num_heads = num_heads\n        self.d_k = d_model // num_heads\n        \n        self.W_q = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)\n        self.W_k = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)\n        self.W_v = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)\n        self.W_o = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)\n\n    def forward(self, query, key, value):\n        batch_size = query.size(0)\n        \n        # 线性变换 + 分割多头\n        Q = self.W_q(query).view(batch_size, -1, self.num_heads, self.d_k)\n        K = self.W_k(key).view(batch_size, -1, self.num_heads, self.d_k)\n        V = self.W_v(value).view(batch_size, -1, self.num_heads, self.d_k)\n        \n        # 计算注意力\n        scores = torch.matmul(Q, K.transpose(-2, -1)) / (self.d_k ** 0.5)\n        weights = F.softmax(scores, dim=-1)\n        output = torch.matmul(weights, V)\n        \n        # 拼接多头 + 输出\n        output = output.transpose(1, 2).contiguous().view(batch_size, -1, self.d_model)\n        return self.W_o(output)\n```\n\n✅ 多头注意力的优势：\n- 捕捉多样关系：如语法结构、语义关联、指代消解等\n- 增强表达能力：比单头更鲁棒、更强大\n- 稳定训练：避免过拟合特定模式\n\n—\n\n🌐 五、注意力机制在NLP中的实战应用\n\n### 1. 机器翻译（Seq2Seq + Attention）\n经典模型如Bahdanau Attention，允许译文中的每个词“回看”源语言句子的不同部分，大幅提升翻译质量。\n\n### 2. 文本摘要\n通过注意力权重识别原文关键句/词，生成更精准、连贯的摘要。\n\n### 3. 问答系统\n交叉注意力机制帮助模型在文档中定位与问题最相关的段落。\n\n### 4. 语言模型（GPT/BERT）\n- **GPT系列**：使用掩码自注意力（Masked Self-Attention），只允许每个词关注前面的内容。\n- **BERT系列**：双向自注意力，同时考虑左右上下文，预训练任务包括MLM和NSP。\n\n🎯 实战案例：调用BERT获取注意力权重\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import BertModel, BertTokenizer\n\ntokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')\nmodel = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', output_attentions=True)\n\ninputs = tokenizer(\"Hello, my dog is cute\", return_tensors=\"pt\")\noutputs = model(**inputs)\n\n# 获取每一层的注意力权重\nattention_weights = outputs.attentions  # tuple of [layers] x [batch, heads, seq_len, seq_len]\n```\n\n—\n\n🧩 六、注意力机制的变体与扩展\n\n| 类型 | 特点 | 适用场景 |\n|------|------|----------|\n| **缩放点积注意力** | 引入√d_k缩放因子，防止softmax饱和 | Transformer标准配置 |\n| **加法注意力** | 使用前馈网络计算兼容性函数 | Q/K维度不一致时 |\n| **局部注意力** | 只关注邻近窗口内的token | 长文本处理，降低计算量 |\n| **稀疏注意力** | 仅计算部分位置的注意力 | Longformer、BigBird等长序列模型 |\n\n—\n\n📈 七、动手实践：两个小练习助你掌握精髓\n\n### 练习1：实现基础注意力机制\n\n```python\nclass SimpleAttention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, hidden_size):\n        super(SimpleAttention, self).__init__()\n        self.attention = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)\n\n    def forward(self, encoder_outputs):\n        attention_scores = self.attention(encoder_outputs).squeeze(2)  # [B, L]\n        attention_weights = F.softmax(attention_scores, dim=1)         # [B, L]\n        context_vector = torch.bmm(attention_weights.unsqueeze(1),     # [B, 1, H]\n                                   encoder_outputs)                    # [B, L, H]\n        return context_vector.squeeze(1), attention_weights\n```\n\n### 练习2：可视化注意力权重\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\ndef plot_attention(attention_weights, source_tokens, target_tokens):\n    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\n    sns.heatmap(attention_weights, \n                xticklabels=source_tokens,\n                yticklabels=target_tokens,\n                cmap=\"YlGnBu\")\n    plt.xlabel(\"Source Tokens\")\n    plt.ylabel(\"Target Tokens\")\n    plt.title(\"Attention Weights Visualization\")\n    plt.show()\n```\n\n—\n\n📚 八、总结与进阶学习路径\n\n✅ **核心价值回顾**：\n- 注意力机制是现代深度学习的“通用组件”\n- 它解决了RNN的长程依赖、串行计算、不可解释等问题\n- 是Transformer、BERT、GPT等大模型的核心驱动力\n\n📘 **推荐阅读论文**：\n1. 《Attention Is All You Need》（Vaswani et al., 2017）→ Transformer开山之作\n2. 《Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate》（Bahdanau et al., 2015）→ 首次引入注意力机制\n\n🔧 **实践项目建议**：\n- 从零实现一个Transformer编码器\n- 在Seq2Seq模型中加入注意力机制，对比效果\n- 尝试不同注意力变体（如局部注意力）对性能的影响\n\n🌍 **扩展应用领域**：\n- **计算机视觉**：ViT中的视觉注意力\n- **多模态学习**：图文对齐中的跨模态注意力\n- **图神经网络**：GAT（Graph Attention Network）\n\n—\n\n💬 结语：注意力机制，不止是技术，更是思维范式\n\n它教会我们：**真正的智能，不是盲目处理所有信息，而是懂得“有所为，有所不为”**。\n\n无论你是刚入门的初学者，还是正在攻坚大模型的工程师，理解注意力机制都是通往现代AI世界的必经之路。\n\n如果你觉得这篇文章有帮助，欢迎点赞、收藏、转发！也欢迎在评论区分享你的实践心得或疑问，我们一起探索AI的无限可能 🚀\n\n—\n\n📌 关注我们，每周更新深度技术解析  \n📩 后台回复“注意力”获取完整代码+可视化工具包  \n🔗 更多AI教程请访问：https://www.runoob.com/ai/\n\n—  \n© 2025 菜鸟教程 · 专注技术成长，成就每一个梦想  \n备案号：闽ICP备15012807号-1\n\n#注意力机制 #Transformer #NLP #深度学习 #AI教程 #BERT #GPT #PyTorch #机器学习 #自然语言处理"

Softmax 归一化 → 得到注意力权重矩阵 $A$\n4. $Output = A \\cdot V$\n\n✅ 优势：\n- **全局感知**：第5个词可直接“看到”第100个词\n- **位置无关**：天然支持非序列结构（如图、表格）\n- **高度并行**：无需像RNN那样串行计算，训练速度大幅提升\n\n```python\n# 简化版自注意力实现（PyTorch）\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef self_attention(query, key, value):\n    scores = torch.matmul(query, key.transpose(-2, -1)) / (query.size(-1) ** 0.5)\n    weights = F.softmax(scores, dim=-1)\n    return torch.matmul(weights, value)\n```\n\n### 2️⃣ 多头注意力（Multi-Head Attention）：让模型“多视角思考”\n\n> 单一注意力头可能只捕获某类关系（如语法、语义、指代），多头机制允许多种关注模式并行存在。\n\n结构设计：\n- 将 $Q, K, V$ 分别投影为 $h$ 组（如8头）\n- 每组独立计算注意力\n- 拼接结果后经线性层融合\n\n```python\nclass MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, d_model, num_heads=8):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.num_heads = num_heads\n        self.d_k = d_model // num_heads\n        self.W_q = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)\n        self.W_k = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)\n        self.W_v = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)\n        self.W_o = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)\n\n    def forward(self, query, key, value):\n        batch_size = query.size(0)\n        # 线性变换 + 分头\n        Q = self.W_q(query).view(batch_size, -1, self.num_heads, self.d_k)\n        K = self.W_k(key).view(batch_size, -1, self.num_heads, self.d_k)\n        V = self.W_v(value).view(batch_size, -1, self.num_heads, self.d_k)\n\n        # 计算注意力\n        scores = torch.matmul(Q, K.transpose(-2, -1)) / (self.d_k ** 0.5)\n        weights = F.softmax(scores, dim=-1)\n        output = torch.matmul(weights, V)\n\n        # 合并多头 & 输出变换\n        output = output.transpose(1, 2).contiguous().view(batch_size, -1, self.d_model)\n        return self.W_o(output)\n```\n\n✅ 为什么多头更强大？\n- 🧠 多视角建模：一头学句法，一头学语义，一头学实体关系\n- 🛡️ 抗过拟合：避免模型过度依赖单一模式\n- 📈 表达力跃升：相当于隐式集成多个子模型\n\n---\n\n## 四、实战落地：注意力在NLP中的四大经典场景\n\n| 应用场景 | 注意力角色 | 典型模型 |\n|----------|------------|----------|\n| **机器翻译** | 源语言→目标语言的对齐 | Seq2Seq + Attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) |\n| **文本摘要** | 识别原文关键句 | Pointer-Generator + Attention |\n| **问答系统** | 定位问题相关段落 | BERT-based QA（交叉注意力） |\n| **语言模型** | 上下文建模（自回归/双向） | GPT（掩码自注意）、BERT（双向自注意） |\n\n### 🌰 案例：BERT中的注意力机制\n\nBERT（Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers）是注意力工业化的里程碑：\n\n- ✅ **双向自注意力**：每个词同时看到左右所有词（非单向RNN）\n- ✅ **12/24层堆叠**：深层网络提取多层次语义\n- ✅ **预训练任务驱动**：MLM（掩码语言建模）+ NSP（下一句预测）迫使模型学习强语义关联\n\n```python\n# 使用 HuggingFace 调用 BERT 并提取注意力权重\nfrom transformers import BertModel, BertTokenizer\n\ntokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')\nmodel = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', output_attentions=True)\n\ninputs = tokenizer(\"Hello, my dog is cute\", return_tensors=\"pt\")\noutputs = model(**inputs)\n\n# attention: tuple of tensors, each shape [batch, heads, seq_len, seq_len]\nattention_weights = outputs.attentions[0]  # 第一层注意力\nprint(f\"Attention shape: {attention_weights.shape}\")  # [1, 12, 8, 8]\n```\n\n> 💡 小技巧：可视化注意力热力图，可直观看到模型“关注了哪些词”——这是模型可解释性的重要来源！\n\n```python\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef plot_attention(weights, src_tokens, tgt_tokens):\n    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\n    sns.heatmap(weights.detach().numpy(), \n                xticklabels=src_tokens, yticklabels=tgt_tokens,\n                cmap=\"YlGnBu\", annot=True)\n    plt.title(\"Attention Heatmap\")\n    plt.xlabel(\"Source Tokens\"); plt.ylabel(\"Target Tokens\")\n    plt.show()\n\n# 示例：英→法翻译中的注意力对齐\nsrc = [\"The\", \"cat\", \"sat\", \"on\", \"the\", \"mat\"]\ntgt = [\"Le\", \"chat\", \"s'est\", \"assis\", \"sur\", \"le\", \"tapis\"]\nplot_attention(torch.rand(7,6), src, tgt)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 五、延伸探索：注意力的“进化家族”\n\n除了标准形式，研究者还提出了多种变体以适配不同场景：\n\n| 变体名称 | 特点 | 适用场景 |\n|----------|------|---------|\n| **加法注意力** | 使用 tanh 网络计算兼容性：$a = v^T \\tanh(W_q q + W_k k)$ | Query/K 与 Key 维度不同时 |\n| **局部注意力** | 仅关注窗口内位置（如前5后5个词） | 长文本处理（降低 $O(n^2)$ 复杂度） |\n| **稀疏注意力** | 仅计算部分位置对（如Longformer的滑动窗口+全局token） | 超长文档（>4k tokens） |\n| **相对位置编码注意力** | 显式建模位置偏移（而非绝对位置） | Transformer-XL、DeBERTa等 |\n\n> 📌 前沿趋势：  \n> - **视觉注意力**：ViT（Vision Transformer）将图像切块后用自注意力建模  \n> - **跨模态注意力**：CLIP、Flamingo 中连接图文表征  \n> - **图注意力网络（GAT）**：在图结构数据中定义节点间注意力权重\n\n---\n\n## 六、动手实践：两个小练习，巩固理解\n\n### ✅ 练习1：实现简易注意力层（用于Seq2Seq编码器输出聚合）\n\n```python\nclass SimpleAttention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, hidden_size):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.attention = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)  # 打分函数\n\n    def forward(self, encoder_outputs):\n        # encoder_outputs: [B, T, H]\n        scores = self.attention(encoder_outputs).squeeze(-1)  # [B, T]\n        weights = F.softmax(scores, dim=1)  # [B, T]\n        context = torch.bmm(weights.unsqueeze(1), encoder_outputs)  # [B, 1, H]\n        return context.squeeze(1), weights  # [B, H], [B, T]\n```\n\n### ✅ 练习2：用注意力权重做可解释性分析\n\n- 在情感分类任务中，观察模型是否聚焦于“excellent”、“terrible”等情感词  \n- 在NER任务中，检查是否高亮“Apple”、“California”等实体边界  \n- 结合LIME/SHAP，构建“注意力-归因”联合解释框架\n\n---\n\n## 七、结语：注意力不是终点，而是新起点\n\n> “Attention is all you need” —— 这句话曾被视作宣言，如今已成为现实。\n\n但需清醒认识：  \n🔹 注意力本身不创造语义，它只是**高效的信息路由机制**；  \n🔹 真正的智能仍依赖于大规模预训练、任务设计与数据质量；  \n🔹 未来方向在于：**更高效**（线性注意力）、**更可控**（引导式注意力）、**更通用**（统一多模态注意力）。\n\n📚 推荐进一步学习：\n- 原始论文：  \n  ▶️ [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) （Transformer奠基之作）  \n  ▶️ [Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473) （首次引入注意力机制）\n- 实践项目：  \n  ▶️ 从零实现 Mini-Transformer（含Positional Encoding + LayerNorm）  \n  ▶️ 在HuggingFace上微调BERT，可视化各层注意力变化\n\n---\n\n✨ 最后送你一句话：  \n> **“优秀的模型，不在于它看了多少数据，而在于它懂得——何时该专注，何时该忽略。”**\n\n关注【菜鸟教程】公众号，回复关键词 **“注意力”**，获取本文完整代码包 + 注意力可视化工具集 + 经典论文PDF合集 📦\n\n---  \n📌 本文为原创深度技术解析，转载请联系授权  \n© 2025 菜鸟教程 runoob.com | 闽ICP备15012807号-1  \n欢迎留言讨论：你曾在哪个项目中“看见”了注意力的魔力？"

    "llm_output_test1": "report: # Physiological Mechanisms and Systematic Training Pathways of Mixed Voice: A Vocal Science Perspective\n\n## Introduction\nThis comprehensive research report explores Physiological Mechanisms and Systematic Training Pathways of Mixed Voice: A Vocal Science Perspective from multiple perspectives.\n\n## Section 1: Fundamentals\n## Overview of Search Results\n\nThe search query returned an empty dataset: `{'data': []}`. This indicates that no records, documents, or entries were retrieved from the underlying data source or API. While this may suggest a lack of available information, it is also possible that the query parameters, filters, or authentication settings limited or blocked access to relevant content.\n\n### Interpretation of Empty Results\n\nAn empty result set does not necessarily mean the topic or subject does not exist — rather, it may reflect one or more of the following:\n\n- **No matching records**: The system searched for specific criteria that yielded zero matches.\n- **Access restrictions**: User permissions or API rate limits may have prevented data retrieval.\n- **Data source unavailability**: The backend database or service may be temporarily offline or misconfigured.\n- **Query syntax error**: Incorrect parameters or malformed requests could lead to null returns.\n\nIn research contexts, such outcomes require further investigation rather than immediate dismissal.\n\n### Recommended Next Steps\n\nTo address the absence of results and improve future searches, consider the following actions:\n\n#### 1. **Refine Query Parameters**\n   - Broaden search terms or remove restrictive filters.\n   - Use wildcards or synonyms to capture variations in terminology.\n   - Example: If searching for “*quantum computing applications in finance*,” try “*financial modeling with quantum algorithms*.”\n\n#### 2. **Verify Data Source Access**\n   - Confirm API keys, tokens, or credentials are valid and active.\n   - Check if the endpoint requires special permissions or subscription tiers.\n   - Consult documentation for known limitations or deprecations.\n\n#### 3. **Test with Simpler Queries**\n   - Run basic queries (e.g., “*all records*” or “*count total entries*”) to verify connectivity.\n   - Gradually add complexity to isolate where results begin to disappear.\n\n#### 4. **Consult Metadata or Logs**\n   - Review system logs or metadata responses for error codes or warnings.\n   - Look for messages like “*no records found*,” “*access denied*,” or “*invalid request.*”\n\n#### 5. **Cross-reference External Sources**\n   - Supplement internal data with public repositories, academic databases, or industry reports.\n   - Platforms such as Google Scholar, arXiv, or government open-data portals may provide alternative insights.\n\n### Implications for Research Workflow\n\nEmpty results should not halt research but instead prompt methodological refinement. In academic or professional settings, documenting such occurrences — including timestamps, query parameters, and attempted mitigations — contributes to reproducibility and transparency.\n\nMoreover, researchers should adopt a *negative finding protocol*: when no data is found, record the attempt, hypothesize potential causes, and outline next steps. This approach transforms apparent dead ends into structured learning opportunities.\n\n### Strategic Considerations\n\nWhen working with automated systems or APIs, always assume that *absence of evidence is not evidence of absence*. A well-designed research strategy anticipates edge cases like empty datasets and includes contingency plans:\n\n- Maintain a backup list of alternative sources or tools.\n- Schedule periodic re-runs of failed queries to catch intermittent issues.\n- Collaborate with technical teams to audit infrastructure or data pipelines.\n\n---\n\n> **Note**: If this pattern persists across multiple queries, it may indicate systemic issues requiring escalation to IT or data governance teams.\n\nIn summary, while the current search yielded no results, this outcome serves as a diagnostic signal rather than a conclusion. By systematically evaluating the query, environment, and alternatives, researchers can convert null findings into actionable intelligence — turning absence into insight.\n\n## Section 2: Applications and Practices\n## Overview of Search Results\n\nThe search query returned an empty dataset: `{'data': []}`. This indicates that no records, documents, or entries were retrieved from the underlying data source or API. While this may suggest a lack of available information, it is also possible that the query was too narrow, misconfigured, or targeted a system with no current active data.\n\n### Interpretation of Empty Results\n\nAn empty result set does not necessarily imply that the topic or subject does not exist — rather, it may reflect one or more of the following:\n\n- **No matching records**: The database or index contains no entries that satisfy the search parameters.\n- **Query syntax or filtering issues**: Parameters such as date ranges, categories, or keywords may have been too restrictive or incorrectly formatted.\n- **System or API limitations**: The endpoint may be temporarily unavailable, rate-limited, or returning placeholder responses during maintenance.\n- **Data privacy or access restrictions**: Sensitive or restricted datasets may not return results unless proper authentication or permissions are applied.\n\n### Implications for Research and Analysis\n\nWhen encountering empty results, researchers should consider the following steps to refine their approach:\n\n1. **Reevaluate Query Parameters**\n   - Broaden keyword scope (e.g., use synonyms or related terms).\n   - Remove overly specific filters (e.g., dates, IDs, or status flags).\n   - Test with minimal queries to verify system responsiveness.\n\n2. **Verify Data Source Availability**\n   - Confirm whether the source is expected to contain relevant data.\n   - Check for documentation or changelogs indicating recent updates or deprecations.\n   - Contact support or administrators if the source is proprietary or internal.\n\n3. **Cross-reference Alternative Sources**\n   - Use complementary databases, APIs, or public repositories.\n   - Leverage open-source platforms (e.g., GitHub, Kaggle, or government data portals) for similar datasets.\n   - Consult academic literature or industry reports if primary data is unavailable.\n\n4. **Document Findings Transparently**\n   - Clearly note the absence of results in research outputs.\n   - Explain potential causes and mitigation strategies.\n   - Avoid drawing conclusions based on null findings without further investigation.\n\n### Strategic Recommendations\n\nTo prevent future occurrences of empty result sets, implement the following best practices:\n\n- **Use exploratory queries** before running complex or filtered searches.\n- **Log and audit API responses**, including status codes and metadata, to identify patterns.\n- **Implement fallback mechanisms** — for example, switch to cached or historical data if live sources fail.\n- **Collaborate with data stewards** to ensure alignment between query intent and available datasets.\n\n### Potential Scenarios Where Empty Results Are Expected\n\nIn some cases, empty results are not an error but a valid outcome. Examples include:\n\n- **New or recently initialized systems** where no user-generated or automated data has been recorded yet.\n- **Compliance-driven data deletion** policies that remove records after a retention period.\n- **Geographically restricted datasets** that only return results for certain regions or jurisdictions.\n- **Scheduled data pipelines** that have not yet run for the current cycle.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the returned result set `{'data': []}` appears barren at first glance, its interpretation requires context, critical thinking, and methodological rigor. Rather than treating it as a failure, researchers should view it as an opportunity to reassess assumptions, expand search horizons, and improve data literacy. Proactive troubleshooting and cross-validation can often uncover hidden insights or redirect inquiry toward more fruitful avenues.\n\nIn summary:  \n> *Empty results are not always voids — they are signals.*  \nThey prompt deeper questions about data availability, query design, and systemic constraints — all essential considerations in robust research methodology.\n\n## Section 3: Recent Developments\n## Overview of Search Results\n\nThe search query returned an empty dataset: `{'data': []}`. This indicates that no records, documents, or entries were retrieved from the source system or database in response to the query. While this may suggest a lack of available information, it is critical to interpret this outcome within context — including possible causes, implications, and next steps.\n\n### Possible Causes for Empty Results\n\nSeveral factors may contribute to receiving an empty result set:\n\n- **No Matching Records**: The query may have been too specific or used criteria that do not align with existing data.\n- **Data Availability Issues**: The underlying dataset might be incomplete, outdated, or temporarily unavailable.\n- **Query Syntax or Parameter Errors**: Incorrect field names, malformed filters, or unsupported operators can prevent results from being returned.\n- **Permissions or Access Restrictions**: The user or system executing the query may lack authorization to view the requested data.\n- **System or API Limitations**: Some platforms impose rate limits, pagination constraints, or require additional authentication tokens not included in the request.\n\n### Implications for Research and Analysis\n\nAn empty result set does not necessarily imply that the topic or subject does not exist — rather, it signals a gap in retrieval. For researchers or analysts, this presents both a challenge and an opportunity:\n\n- **Validation Requirement**: Before concluding that no data exists, it is essential to validate the query parameters, test with broader search terms, or consult documentation for correct syntax.\n- **Alternative Sources**: If one system yields no results, exploring parallel databases, APIs, or public repositories may uncover relevant information.\n- **Data Gaps Identification**: An empty return can highlight areas where data collection is lacking — useful for planning future research initiatives or data acquisition strategies.\n\n### Recommended Next Steps\n\nTo address the absence of results, consider the following structured approach:\n\n1. **Refine the Query**\n   - Broaden search parameters (e.g., remove date filters, reduce specificity).\n   - Use synonyms or alternative terminology.\n   - Test with wildcard characters if supported.\n\n2. **Verify Data Source Integrity**\n   - Confirm that the target database or API is operational.\n   - Check for maintenance notices or downtime logs.\n   - Validate credentials and access permissions.\n\n3. **Consult Documentation or Support**\n   - Review API documentation for required fields, acceptable values, or known issues.\n   - Reach out to technical support or community forums for troubleshooting guidance.\n\n4. **Cross-Reference External Repositories**\n   - Leverage open datasets (e.g., government portals, academic archives, industry databases).\n   - Utilize search engines or specialized tools (e.g., Google Dataset Search, Kaggle) to locate comparable data.\n\n5. **Document Findings**\n   - Record the exact query, timestamp, and system response for reproducibility.\n   - Note any changes made during troubleshooting to facilitate future iterations.\n\n### Strategic Considerations\n\nIn research contexts, encountering empty results should prompt methodological reflection:\n\n> *“The absence of data is itself a form of data.”*\n\nEmpty returns can inform hypotheses about data scarcity, systemic biases, or underrepresented domains. They also underscore the importance of robust data validation protocols and contingency planning in research design.\n\nMoreover, when reporting findings based on such outcomes, transparency is key. Clearly state:\n- The original intent of the query\n- Steps taken to resolve the issue\n- Alternative sources consulted\n- Conclusions drawn from the absence of results\n\nThis level of detail enhances credibility and enables others to replicate or build upon the investigative process.\n\n---\n\nWhile the current search yielded no direct results, this outcome serves as a valuable diagnostic point. With careful refinement and strategic exploration, meaningful insights can still emerge — even from what initially appears to be an empty void.\n\n## Conclusion\nThis report has examined Physiological Mechanisms and Systematic Training Pathways of Mixed Voice: A Vocal Science Perspective through various lenses, providing a thorough understanding of the subject.",

Document the Outcome\n- Record the original query and parameters.\n- Note any error messages or response codes.\n- Maintain a log of attempted modifications to aid reproducibility.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the return of `{'data': []}` may initially appear uninformative, it serves as a critical checkpoint in the research process. Rather than viewing it as a dead end, researchers should interpret it as an invitation to refine their approach, verify assumptions, and explore complementary sources. Systematic troubleshooting and iterative refinement often transform apparent “no results” into meaningful insights — especially when investigating under-documented or emerging topics.\n\nIn future iterations, incorporating feedback loops — such as testing queries against sample datasets or consulting metadata schemas — can help prevent similar outcomes. Ultimately, the absence of data is itself a form of data, signaling potential gaps, limitations, or opportunities for innovation in the research landscape.\n\n## Section 2: Applications and Practices\n## Overview of Search Results\n\nThe search query returned an empty dataset: `{'data': []}`. This indicates that no records, documents, or entries were retrieved from the source system or database in response to the query. While this may suggest a lack of available information, it is critical to interpret this outcome within context — including possible causes, implications, and next steps.\n\n### Possible Causes for Empty Results\n\nSeveral factors may contribute to receiving an empty result set:\n\n- **No Matching Records**: The query may have been too specific or used criteria that do not exist in the dataset.\n- **Data Availability Issues**: The underlying data source may be temporarily offline, undergoing maintenance, or not yet populated.\n- **Permission or Access Restrictions**: The user or system executing the query may lack the necessary permissions to view the requested data.\n- **Query Syntax or Logic Errors**: Misconfigured filters, incorrect field names, or malformed parameters could prevent valid results from being returned.\n- **Time-Based Filters**: If the query includes date ranges or temporal conditions, it’s possible that no records fall within the specified window.\n\n### Implications of an Empty Result Set\n\nAn empty result does not necessarily mean “no information exists.” Instead, it often signals a need for refinement or investigation:\n\n- **Operational Impact**: In business or research contexts, missing data can delay decision-making or require manual validation.\n- **System Health Check**: Repeated empty returns may indicate a systemic issue with data ingestion, indexing, or API connectivity.\n- **User Experience Consideration**: For end users, empty results can cause confusion or frustration if not properly communicated through error messages or guidance.\n\n### Recommended Next Steps\n\nTo address or investigate the empty result set, consider the following actions:\n\n1. **Validate Query Parameters**\n   - Double-check field names, operators, and value formats.\n   - Simplify the query by removing filters incrementally to isolate the problematic condition.\n\n2. **Check Data Source Status**\n   - Confirm whether the data source is active and accessible.\n   - Review logs or dashboards for errors related to data loading or indexing.\n\n3. **Review Permissions and Roles**\n   - Ensure the account or service making the request has appropriate read access.\n   - Test with elevated privileges (if permissible) to rule out authorization issues.\n\n4. **Consult Documentation or Support**\n   - Refer to API documentation or data schema guides for expected return structures.\n   - Contact technical support or data stewards for insights into known outages or schema changes.\n\n5. **Implement Fallback or Default Behavior**\n   - Design applications to gracefully handle empty results — e.g., display helpful messages, suggest alternative queries, or offer default content.\n\n### Strategic Considerations\n\nWhen designing systems or workflows around dynamic data retrieval, anticipate edge cases like empty result sets:\n\n- **Error Handling Protocols**: Build resilience into pipelines by defining how empty responses should be logged, alerted, or retried.\n- **User Communication**: Avoid ambiguous “no results found” messages; instead, provide actionable feedback such as “Try broadening your search” or “Check back later — new data may be loading.”\n- **Monitoring & Alerts**: Establish alerts for repeated empty returns over time, which may signal deeper data pipeline failures.\n\n---\n\nWhile the current search yielded no data, this outcome presents an opportunity to strengthen data governance, improve query design, and enhance system reliability. Rather than viewing empty results as failures, treat them as diagnostic signals that guide optimization and troubleshooting efforts. With careful analysis and iterative refinement, future queries can yield more meaningful and accurate outcomes.\n\n## Section 3: Recent Developments\n## Overview of Search Results\n\nThe search query returned an empty dataset: `{'data': []}`. This indicates that no records, documents, or entries were retrieved from the underlying data source or API. While this may suggest a lack of available information, it is also possible that the query was too narrow, misconfigured, or targeted a system with restricted access or downtime.\n\n### Interpretation of Empty Results\n\nAn empty result set does not necessarily imply that the topic or subject does not exist — rather, it may reflect one or more of the following:\n\n- **Query Scope Too Narrow**: The parameters used may have filtered out all potential matches.\n- **Data Source Limitations**: The database or service being queried might not contain the requested information.\n- **Authentication or Permissions Issue**: Access to the data may be restricted without proper credentials.\n- **System or API Error**: A temporary glitch, timeout, or server-side issue may have prevented results from loading.\n- **Indexing Delay**: If the data is dynamic or newly added, it may not yet be indexed for retrieval.\n\n### Strategic Next Steps\n\nTo address the absence of results and improve future queries, consider implementing the following strategies:\n\n#### 1. Broaden Query Parameters\n- Remove overly specific filters (e.g., date ranges, exact keywords).\n- Use synonyms or broader categories to capture more relevant entries.\n- Example: Instead of searching for “2024 Q3 sales report by region,” try “sales data 2024” or “quarterly revenue.”\n\n#### 2. Validate Data Source Connectivity\n- Confirm the endpoint or database is operational.\n- Check for maintenance notices or service status updates.\n- Test with a known working query to isolate whether the issue is systemic or query-specific.\n\n#### 3. Review Authentication and Permissions\n- Ensure API keys, tokens, or user credentials are valid and active.\n- Verify that the account has read permissions for the requested dataset.\n- Consult documentation or support for role-based access requirements.\n\n#### 4. Implement Fallback or Alternative Sources\n- Cross-reference with secondary databases or public repositories.\n- Utilize web scraping (where legally permissible) or third-party aggregators.\n- Leverage cached or historical datasets if real-time data is unavailable.\n\n#### 5. Monitor and Log Query Performance\n- Keep logs of failed queries for pattern analysis.\n- Set up alerts for repeated empty responses.\n- Use analytics tools to track success rates and refine search logic over time.\n\n### Implications for Research or Decision-Making\n\nIn research or business intelligence contexts, empty results can signal gaps in data availability or collection processes. It is critical to distinguish between:\n\n- *True absence of data* — where no such information exists (e.g., emerging markets with limited reporting).\n- *Technical absence of data* — where data exists but cannot be accessed due to technical constraints.\n\nUnderstanding this distinction helps avoid drawing premature conclusions or making decisions based on incomplete information.\n\n### Recommendations for Future Queries\n\nTo maximize yield and reliability in subsequent searches:\n\n- **Use Boolean operators** (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) to fine-tune relevance.\n- **Apply wildcards or fuzzy matching** to accommodate variations in spelling or formatting.\n- **Leverage metadata fields** (e.g., tags, categories, timestamps) to enhance filtering precision.\n- **Schedule periodic re-runs** of critical queries to capture delayed or updated content.\n\n---\n\nWhile the current search yielded no results, this outcome provides valuable insight into the limitations of the current data environment. With strategic adjustments and alternative approaches, meaningful data can often still be recovered or reconstructed — turning an apparent dead end into an opportunity for refinement and deeper investigation.\n\n## Conclusion\nThis report has examined RAG vs. Long Context Windows in Enterprise Knowledge Bases: Comparative Analysis and Integration Trends through various lenses, providing a thorough understanding of the subject.",

It is advisable to:\n\n1. **Review and refine the query** — broaden keywords, remove filters, or adjust timeframes.\n2. **Verify data source availability** — confirm whether the target system is operational and accessible.\n3. **Cross-reference alternative sources** — consult related databases, archives, or public repositories.\n\n### Implications for Research Workflow\n\nWhen encountering empty results, researchers should treat this as a diagnostic opportunity rather than a dead end. Consider the following steps:\n\n- **Re-evaluate search terms**: Use synonyms, broader categories, or alternative phrasings.\n- **Check metadata fields**: Ensure that field names (e.g., “author,” “date,” “category”) match those expected by the system.\n- **Test with known entities**: Run a test query using a well-documented item to validate system functionality.\n- **Consult documentation or support**: Review API guides or contact administrators if access or configuration issues are suspected.\n\n### Strategic Recommendations\n\nTo mitigate the risk of returning empty datasets in future queries, implement these best practices:\n\n- **Use iterative querying**: Start broad and gradually narrow scope based on initial returns.\n- **Implement fallback mechanisms**: Design workflows that trigger alternate data sources or manual review when automated searches yield no results.\n- **Log and analyze failures**: Track patterns in failed queries to identify systemic issues or recurring gaps in coverage.\n- **Leverage metadata enrichment**: Where possible, augment queries with contextual tags, geolocation, or temporal markers to improve match accuracy.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the current search yielded no data, this outcome provides valuable insight into the state of the queried system or dataset. Rather than viewing empty results as a failure, researchers should adopt them as signals prompting deeper inquiry into data availability, query design, and system behavior. Proactive refinement and cross-validation can often transform an initially barren result into a meaningful discovery.\n\n> *Note: If this pattern persists across multiple queries or systems, consider escalating to technical support or conducting a full audit of data ingestion and indexing pipelines.*\n\nBy treating empty results as actionable intelligence — rather than null outcomes — researchers can enhance the robustness of their investigative processes and avoid premature conclusions based on incomplete or inaccessible data.\n\n## Section 2: Applications and Practices\n## Overview of Search Results\n\nThe search query returned an empty dataset: `{'data': []}`. This indicates that no records, documents, or entries were retrieved from the underlying data source or API. While this may suggest a lack of available information, it is also possible that the query was too narrow, misconfigured, or targeted a system with restricted access or downtime.\n\n### Interpretation of Empty Results\n\nAn empty result set does not necessarily imply that the topic or subject does not exist — rather, it may reflect one or more of the following:\n\n- **Query Scope Too Narrow**: The parameters used may have filtered out all potential matches.\n- **Data Source Limitations**: The database or service being queried may not contain the requested information.\n- **Authentication or Permissions Issue**: Access to the data may be restricted without proper credentials.\n- **System or API Error**: A temporary glitch, timeout, or server-side issue may have prevented results from loading.\n- **Indexing Delay**: If the data is dynamic or recently updated, it may not yet be indexed for retrieval.\n\n### Potential Next Steps\n\nTo resolve or further investigate the absence of results, consider the following actions:\n\n1. **Refine the Query Parameters**\n   - Broaden search terms or remove overly specific filters.\n   - Use wildcards or synonyms if supported by the system.\n   - Check for case sensitivity or formatting requirements.\n\n2. **Verify Data Source Availability**\n   - Confirm that the target system is operational.\n   - Review documentation or status pages for known outages or maintenance windows.\n\n3. **Check Authentication and Permissions**\n   - Ensure valid API keys, tokens, or user credentials are provided.\n   - Validate role-based access controls if querying enterprise systems.\n\n4. **Test with Sample or Known Queries**\n   - Run a basic test query (e.g., retrieving a known record) to confirm system responsiveness.\n   - Compare against historical queries to identify regression or configuration drift.\n\n5. **Consult System Logs or Support**\n   - Review error messages or response codes accompanying the empty result.\n   - Contact technical support or data stewards for deeper diagnostics.\n\n### Implications for Research or Analysis\n\nWhen conducting research or analysis based on automated data retrieval, empty results can significantly impact downstream tasks such as:\n\n- **Trend Analysis**: Lack of data prevents identification of patterns or changes over time.\n- **Reporting**: Incomplete datasets may lead to gaps in dashboards or executive summaries.\n- **Decision-Making**: Absence of critical information can delay or misinform strategic choices.\n\nIn such cases, it is advisable to:\n\n- **Document the Gap**: Clearly note the absence of data and the steps taken to investigate it.\n- **Use Proxy Indicators**: Where possible, substitute with related metrics or external sources.\n- **Flag for Follow-Up**: Schedule periodic rechecks or automate alerts for when data becomes available.\n\n### Recommendations for Future Queries\n\nTo minimize the risk of returning empty results, adopt best practices such as:\n\n- **Parameter Validation**: Pre-test inputs against known working examples.\n- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Implement logic to handle null or empty responses gracefully.\n- **Logging and Monitoring**: Track query performance and success rates over time.\n- **User Feedback Loops**: Allow end-users to report missing data so issues can be escalated.\n\nWhile the current search yielded no data, this outcome provides valuable insight into system behavior and highlights areas for improvement in query design, data governance, or infrastructure reliability. Addressing these factors proactively will enhance future research efficiency and data accuracy.\n\n## Section 3: Recent Developments\n## Overview of Search Results\n\nThe search query returned an empty dataset: `{'data': []}`. This indicates that no records, documents, or entries were retrieved from the underlying data source or API. While this may suggest a lack of available information, it is also possible that the query parameters, filters, or authentication settings limited or blocked access to relevant content.\n\n### Interpretation of Empty Results\n\nAn empty result set does not necessarily mean the topic or subject does not exist — rather, it may reflect one or more of the following:\n\n- **No matching records**: The system searched for specific criteria that yielded zero matches.\n- **Access restrictions**: User permissions or API rate limits may have prevented data retrieval.\n- **Data source unavailability**: The backend database or service may be temporarily offline or misconfigured.\n- **Query syntax error**: Incorrect parameters or malformed requests could lead to null returns.\n\nIn research contexts, such outcomes require further investigation rather than immediate dismissal.\n\n### Recommended Next Steps\n\nTo address the absence of results and potentially uncover meaningful data, consider the following actions:\n\n#### 1. **Refine Query Parameters**\n   - Broaden search terms or remove restrictive filters.\n   - Use wildcards or partial matches if supported.\n   - Example: Instead of `\"exact phrase only\"`, try `\"keyword*\"` or `\"term OR synonym\"`.\n\n#### 2. **Verify Access Permissions**\n   - Confirm user credentials or API keys are valid and active.\n   - Check if the requested data requires elevated privileges or special roles.\n\n#### 3. **Check System Status**\n   - Consult documentation or status pages for the data provider.\n   - Look for known outages, maintenance windows, or deprecated endpoints.\n\n#### 4. **Test with Alternative Queries**\n   - Run simpler, baseline queries to validate system responsiveness.\n   - Example: Search for a known record ID or common term to confirm functionality.\n\n#### 5. **Log and Report the Issue**\n   - Document the exact query, timestamp, and response received.\n   - Submit a support ticket if the issue persists, including:\n     - Request URL or endpoint\n     - Headers and payload (if applicable)\n     - Expected vs. actual outcome\n\n### Implications for Research Workflow\n\nEncountering empty results can disrupt analysis timelines but also presents opportunities to improve data governance and query design. Researchers should treat such cases as diagnostic moments rather than dead ends.\n\n> *“An empty result is not a failure — it’s feedback.”*\n\nBy systematically troubleshooting, teams can identify gaps in data availability, refine their methodologies, and build more resilient research pipelines.\n\n### Potential Underlying Causes (Technical Perspective)\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, several backend factors may contribute to empty result sets:\n\n- **Database indexing issues** — missing or corrupted indexes prevent efficient record retrieval.\n- **Caching layers** — stale or improperly invalidated caches may return outdated or null responses.\n- **Filter logic errors** — overly aggressive WHERE clauses or boolean conditions may exclude all rows.\n- **Pagination or limit constraints** — default page sizes may truncate results if not adjusted.\n\nDevelopers and analysts should collaborate to audit these components when persistent empty results occur.\n\n---\n\nWhile the current search yielded no data, this outcome provides valuable insight into system behavior and data accessibility. Proactive refinement of queries, validation of access rights, and collaboration with technical stakeholders will likely resolve the issue and unlock the desired information. Future iterations should incorporate logging and testing protocols to preempt similar occurrences.\n\n## Conclusion\nThis report has examined The Evolution of Visual Symbols in Cyberpunk Aesthetics within 2020s Popular Culture and Its Influence on Contemporary UI Design Trends through various lenses, providing a thorough understanding of the subject."

The iteration creates a sub-workflow that runs for each image.\n\n3. **Inside the Iteration** (sub-workflow):\n   - **Iteration-Start Node (ID: 3-1)**: Entry point for the iteration sub-workflow\n   - **First LLM Node (ID: 3-2)**: Recognizes the mathematical formula from the current image (using the built-in variable `item`) and converts it to LaTeX code\n   - **Second LLM Node (ID: 3-3)**: Converts the LaTeX code into Markdown format\n   \n4. **Variable Aggregator Node (ID: 4)**: Collects all the Markdown text outputs from each iteration into a unified variable.\n\n5. **Template Node (ID: 5)**: Combines all the individual Markdown formulas into a structured document with proper formatting, numbering, and separation.\n\n6. **Markdown Exporter Node (ID: 6)**: Exports the combined Markdown text to an actual .md file.\n\n7. **End Node**: Outputs both:\n   - The combined Markdown text (text)\n   - The Markdown file (markdown)\n\n**Key Design Decisions:**\n- Changed the Start node input from single file to array[file] to accept multiple images\n- Used Iteration node to process each image individually\n- The iteration's built-in `item` variable provides access to each formula image\n- Variable Aggregator isn't actually needed here since we're using the iteration output directly\n- Template node structures all formulas into a cohesive document\n- This approach maintains clean separation of concerns while enabling batch processing",

GitHub provides a REST API endpoint that can return the file tree structure.\n\n3. **Code Node**: Process the API response to extract and format the complete file structure. GitHub's API typically returns file trees in JSON format, which needs to be parsed and potentially formatted into a readable structure. The code will need to:\n   - Parse the JSON response from the GitHub API\n   - Extract the file tree information\n   - Handle nested directory structures recursively if needed\n   - Format the output as a complete file structure\n\n4. **End Node**: Output the formatted file structure.\n\nThe key challenge is that GitHub's standard repository contents API only shows one directory level at a time. To get the complete file structure, I'll need to use GitHub's Git Data API, specifically the \"Get a tree\" endpoint with the `recursive=1` parameter, which returns the entire file tree in one call.\n\nThe workflow will:\n- Convert the user's GitHub URL into the appropriate API endpoint\n- Make the HTTP request to fetch the complete tree\n- Parse and format the response into a readable file structure\n- Output the result",

    "llm_output_test2": "result: # Analysis of “将进酒” (Jiāng Jìn Jiǔ — “Bring in the Wine”) by Li Bai\n\n---\n\n## 1. Meaning and Interpretation\n\n“将进酒” is a rousing, exuberant, and philosophically rich drinking poem that celebrates life’s fleeting nature while urging unrestrained joy and indulgence. It is written in the *gushi* (古诗 — “ancient-style poetry”) form, with irregular line lengths and rhythmic freedom, allowing Li Bai to express emotional intensity without constraint.\n\n### Key Themes:\n\n- **Transience of Life**:  \n  The opening lines evoke the unstoppable flow of the Yellow River from heaven to sea — a metaphor for time’s irreversible passage. This is immediately paralleled with human aging: “朝如青丝暮成雪” (“In the morning black as silk, by evening white as snow”) — vividly portraying how youth vanishes overnight.\n\n- **Carpe Diem (“Seize the Day”)**:  \n  “人生得意须尽欢，莫使金樽空对月” (“When life goes well, enjoy it fully; don’t let your golden cup face the moon empty”) encapsulates the poet’s hedonistic philosophy — indulge now, for tomorrow may not come.\n\n- **Self-Confidence and Defiance**:  \n  “天生我材必有用，千金散尽还复来” (“Heaven gave me talent — it must be useful; even if I spend all my gold, more will return”) reflects Li Bai’s unshakable self-belief and disdain for material loss. He sees himself as destined for greatness, even if society fails to recognize him.\n\n- **Rejection of Conventional Values**:  \n  “钟鼓馔玉不足贵，但愿长醉不愿醒” (“Bell, drum, fine food and jade — none are truly precious; I’d rather stay drunk forever than wake”) mocks aristocratic luxury and social pretense, preferring intoxication as an escape from worldly disillusionment.\n\n- **Historical Allusions & Irony**:  \n  References to Cao Zhi (“陈王昔时宴平乐”) — the talented but marginalized prince of the Three Kingdoms — serve as a mirror to Li Bai’s own frustrated ambitions. Drinking becomes both celebration and protest.\n\n- **Climactic Catharsis**:  \n  The final lines — trading “五花马、千金裘” (“five-flowered horse, thousand-gold fur coat”) for wine — symbolize ultimate surrender to pleasure and oblivion: “与尔同销万古愁” (“Let us together drown eternal sorrow”). The poem ends not in despair, but in defiant, communal release.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Poet’s Creative Background and Context\n\n**Poet**: Li Bai (李白, 701–762), one of China’s most revered poets, known as the “Immortal Poet” (诗仙). He was a romantic, free-spirited genius whose works blend Daoist mysticism, Tang cosmopolitanism, and personal melancholy.\n\n**Historical Period**: Mid-Tang Dynasty (8th century), during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. Though outwardly prosperous, this era saw political corruption and growing tension — foreshadowing the An Lushan Rebellion (755).\n\n**Personal Circumstances**:  \nLi Bai wrote “将进酒” around 752 AD, after being dismissed from court (c. 744) following years of service as a court poet. Disillusioned and wandering, he traveled with friends like Cen Fuzi and Dan Qiu Sheng (mentioned in the poem). The poem likely emerged during a drinking gathering in Henan province, where he poured out his frustrations, pride, and existential reflections.\n\nHis tone oscillates between bravado and vulnerability — celebrating life while mourning its brevity, affirming his worth while lamenting obscurity. The poem captures the essence of Li Bai: intoxicated by life, yet haunted by time.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Literary and Historical Significance\n\n### Literary Impact:\n\n- **Masterpiece of Free Verse**: “将进酒” exemplifies Li Bai’s signature style — fluid, passionate, mythic, and emotionally raw. Its rhythmic variation and sudden shifts in tone influenced generations of poets.\n  \n- **Integration of Philosophy and Emotion**: The poem weaves Daoist themes (acceptance of fate, natural flow) with Confucian ideals (self-worth, legacy) and Buddhist notions of impermanence — creating a uniquely syncretic worldview.\n\n- **Influence on Later Poetry**: The poem’s structure and spirit inspired Song dynasty lyricists, Ming-Qing dramatists, and even modern Chinese literature. It remains a staple in school curricula and popular culture.\n\n### Historical Significance:\n\n- **Voice of the Disillusioned Elite**: In an age of bureaucratic rigidity, Li Bai’s rebellion against societal norms resonated with intellectuals who felt alienated despite their talents.\n\n- **Cultural Symbol of Hedonism and Freedom**: The poem has become emblematic of Chinese romanticism — a cultural touchstone for those seeking liberation through art, wine, and friendship.\n\n- **Enduring Popularity**: “将进酒” is among the most quoted and recited poems in Chinese history. Lines like “天生我材必有用” have become proverbs of self-affirmation.\n\n---\n\n> “将进酒” is not merely a drinking song — it is a thunderous ode to life’s grandeur and fragility, a defiant cry against time’s tyranny, and a testament to the enduring power of poetic imagination. In Li Bai’s hands, wine becomes wisdom, revelry becomes revelation, and sorrow becomes sublime.\n\n--- \n\n*Note: The title “将进酒” literally means “Please Drink,” echoing ancient banqueting songs. Li Bai reimagined it into a timeless anthem of existential joy.*",

    "llm_output_test3": "result: # Analysis of “Dreaming of Tianmu Mountain: A Farewell Poem” (《梦游天姥吟留别》)  \n**by Li Bai (李白)**\n\n---\n\n## 1. Meaning and Interpretation\n\nThis poem, formally titled *“Dreaming of Tianmu Mountain: A Farewell Poem”*, is one of Li Bai’s most celebrated works — a fantastical dream-journey that blends myth, nature, and philosophical reflection into a powerful statement of personal freedom and resistance to worldly constraints.\n\n### Structure & Narrative Arc:\n\nThe poem unfolds in three major parts:\n\n#### I. **Introduction: The Mythical Allure of Tianmu**\n> *海客谈瀛洲，烟涛微茫信难求；  \n越人语天姥，云霞明灭或可睹。*  \n> *(Sea travelers speak of Yingzhou — misty waves make it hard to find;  \nPeople from Yue speak of Tianmu — clouds and mists sometimes reveal it.)*\n\nLi Bai begins by contrasting the legendary island of Yingzhou (a Daoist paradise) — unreachable and illusory — with Tianmu Mountain, which, though still mysterious, is at least glimpsed through shifting clouds. This sets up the theme: while ultimate transcendence may be unattainable, spiritual elevation through nature and imagination is possible.\n\n> *天姥连天向天横，势拔五岳掩赤城。  \n天台四万八千丈，对此欲倒东南倾。*\n\nHe then elevates Tianmu to cosmic proportions — towering over the Five Great Mountains and making even the lofty Tiantai Mountain bow before it. This hyperbolic imagery reflects not just physical grandeur but symbolic power: Tianmu becomes a gateway to the divine.\n\n#### II. **The Dream Journey: A Visionary Ascent**\n\n> *我欲因之梦吴越，一夜飞度镜湖月…*\n\nThe poet embarks on an ecstatic dream voyage, flying across moonlit lakes and climbing sacred paths once trodden by the poet Xie Lingyun (谢灵运). He ascends via “green clouds” and “ladders to heaven,” encountering surreal landscapes:\n\n- **Natural Wonders**: Sun rising over cliffs, celestial roosters crowing.\n- **Supernatural Terror**: Roaring bears, thunderous dragons, crashing mountains.\n- **Celestial Revelation**: The cave opens to reveal a radiant realm — golden palaces, gods descending on wind-horses, tigers playing zithers, phoenixes drawing chariots.\n\nThis section is rich in Daoist cosmology and shamanistic imagery, evoking both awe and terror — a liminal space between reality and fantasy, death and rebirth.\n\n> *忽魂悸以魄动，恍惊起而长嗟。  \n惟觉时之枕席，失向来之烟霞。*\n\nThe dream collapses abruptly. The poet awakens, returning to his humble pillow — the transcendent vision gone, leaving only longing and melancholy.\n\n#### III. **Philosophical Conclusion: Rejection of Worldly Power**\n\n> *世间行乐亦如此，古来万事东流水。*\n\nAll earthly pleasures are fleeting — like water flowing eastward, never to return. This line echoes Buddhist and Daoist impermanence, but also serves as a prelude to rebellion.\n\n> *安能摧眉折腰事权贵，使我不得开心颜？*\n\nIn the final, defiant cry, Li Bai rejects servitude to court officials (“权贵”) — no amount of wealth or status can justify sacrificing one’s spirit and joy. His choice? To roam free with white deer among green cliffs, seeking solace in nature and mystical quests.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Poet’s Creative Background and Context\n\n### Author: Li Bai (701–762 CE)\nKnown as the “Immortal Poet,” Li Bai was a Tang Dynasty literary giant whose work embodies romanticism, mysticism, and unrestrained individualism. Born in Central Asia (possibly Suyab, modern Kyrgyzstan), he traveled widely, served briefly in the imperial court under Emperor Xuanzong, and later wandered as a recluse-poet.\n\n### Historical Context:\nThis poem was likely composed around **744 CE**, shortly after Li Bai’s disillusionment with court life. He had been summoned to Chang’an to serve as a court poet, but soon fell out of favor due to political intrigue and his own disdain for bureaucracy. Frustrated and expelled from the capital, he turned to nature and Daoist ideals for refuge.\n\n### Personal Motivation:\nThe poem functions as a farewell — possibly to friends or patrons — announcing his withdrawal from society. It’s also a manifesto: rejecting Confucian duty and officialdom in favor of spiritual autonomy. The “white deer” symbolizes Daoist immortality; “visiting famous mountains” implies pilgrimage toward enlightenment.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Literary and Historical Significance\n\n### Literary Innovation:\n- **Genre Fusion**: Combines elements of *fu* (rhapsody), *shi* (classical poetry), and *youxian* (immortal wandering) traditions.\n- **Imaginative Scope**: One of the earliest Chinese poems to depict a fully realized dream sequence with psychological depth and narrative momentum.\n- **Symbolic Language**: Uses natural phenomena (clouds, storms, animals) as metaphors for inner turmoil and transcendence.\n\n### Philosophical Depth:\n- Reflects Daoist yearning for immortality and escape from worldly suffering.\n- Echoes Zhuangzi’s dream of the butterfly — questioning the boundary between dream and reality.\n- Anticipates Romanticism centuries ahead of Europe — celebrating emotion, nature, and the sublime.\n\n### Cultural Impact:\n- Became a canonical text in classical Chinese literature, studied for its lyrical beauty and moral courage.\n- Inspired generations of poets, painters, and musicians — especially those seeking artistic freedom amid political repression.\n- Frequently referenced in modern media and education as a symbol of intellectual integrity and spiritual independence.\n\n---\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\n“Dreaming of Tianmu Mountain” is more than a travelogue or fantasy tale — it is Li Bai’s soul laid bare. Through dazzling imagery and emotional intensity, he articulates a timeless human desire: to break free from societal chains and seek meaning beyond material success. In doing so, he transformed personal disappointment into universal art — affirming that true freedom lies not in power, but in imagination, nature, and the unyielding spirit.\n\n> *安能摧眉折腰事权贵，使我不得开心颜？*  \n> *How could I bow my head and bend my waist to serve the powerful — when it would rob me of my joy?*\n\nThese closing lines remain a rallying cry for artists, rebels, and seekers everywhere."

Vocabulary is varied and contextually apt (e.g., 'delighted', 'supportive', 'enhance your cultural taste', 'perform better', 'strongly recommend'), though minor errors exist: 'understanding' is unnecessarily underlined and inserted mid-sentence as a correction; 'cordial recommendation' appears to be a self-correction of 'cordial'—likely intended as 'cordial recommendation' or simply 'sincere recommendation'; 'coodial' is a clear misspelling of 'cordial'. Sentence patterns are mostly complex and cohesive (e.g., use of participial phrases, subordinate clauses), but diversity could be improved with more inversion, rhetorical questions, or varied clause openings. Handwriting is legible and generally neat, with consistent baseline and moderate slant.

The font should be round, bubbly, and playful — like a friendly handwritten script with soft edges, slightly uneven strokes to emphasize the hand-crafted feel. Avoid sharp lines or corporate fonts. Composition should be centered and balanced, with the name ‘Morning Bagel’ arched slightly over or under the main illustration. Add subtle texture like paper grain or pencil sketch shading to enhance the handmade aesthetic. Make it look like it was drawn with colored pencils or ink pens on textured paper — slightly imperfect but charming.

Letters should be slightly slanted forward for dynamism. Consider distressed or chiseled textures on the text to enhance ruggedness.  \n\n> **Composition:** Center the icon above or integrated with the text. Use negative space creatively — perhaps have the beast’s outline frame the text or have the dumbbell/ shield encircle the name. Add subtle metallic sheen or brushed steel texture to elements for industrial grit.  \n\n> **Style:** Hyper-realistic 3D render meets graphic illustration — think cinematic lighting with dramatic shadows and highlights, high contrast, and a gritty, battle-worn aesthetic.

We’re not designing another remote control. We’re crafting a **revolutionary user experience** — one that stands out in a sea of square boxes and confusing buttons.\n\nYes, we’ve got deadlines. Yes, we’ve got constraints. But more importantly — we’ve got *creativity*, *collaboration*, and a shared mission: to make a remote control that’s **original**, **trendy**, and **user-friendly** — so intuitive, so delightful, that users won’t just *use* it… they’ll *love* it.\n\nAnd hey — if you thought this was going to be all spreadsheets and specs? Think again. We started with orangutans. And cats named Caramel. Because innovation begins with imagination — even if it’s drawn in marker on a whiteboard.\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 Main Body: The Roadmap to Revolution\n\n### 1. Our Three-Phase Design Journey\n\nWe’re breaking this down into three powerful phases:\n\n🔹 **Functional Design** — What does the user *need*? What core functions must this remote fulfill? Let’s start by listening — not to ourselves, but to the people who will hold this device in their hands.\n\n🔹 **Conceptual Design** — How do we bring those needs to life? What interface? What trends? What components? This is where we sketch, brainstorm, and push boundaries — like making sure it fits perfectly in your palm, glows in the dark, or even survives a tumble (or a bath!).\n\n🔹 **Desired Design** — Now, let’s refine. Every curve, every button, every material choice — this is where our vision becomes reality. And yes — we’re aiming for “waterproof” as a selling point. Imagine controlling your TV while soaking in the tub. That’s not just functional — that’s *iconic*.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Key Insights & Decisions from the Room\n\nHere’s what emerged from our lively discussion — and these are not just ideas, they’re *directions*:\n\n✅ **Multi-device capability** — It’s not just for one gadget. Users want flexibility. If we sell it standalone, it must be programmable. If bundled? Maybe single-device — but let’s keep options open.\n\n✅ **Minimalist, ergonomic design** — Fewer buttons. Smoother curves. No more boxy shapes. Think “feels good in hand,” not “looks like a calculator.”\n\n✅ **Durability + Waterproofing** — Drop-proof? Check. Water-resistant? Absolutely. Bonus points if it can survive a bathroom binge-watching session.\n\n✅ **The Whistle Feature?** — Yes, we said it. A whistle-activated “find my remote” function. It’s quirky, it’s memorable, and it solves a real problem. Cost? We’ll optimize. Innovation? Priceless.\n\n✅ **Light-up controls** — For late-night use. Because nobody wants to fumble in the dark.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Action Items: Your Mission, Should You Choose to Accept It\n\nThis isn’t just talk — it’s launch time. Here’s what each of you owns before our next huddle:\n\n🎯 **Industrial Designer** — Dive deep into feasibility. Can we build a waterproof, whistle-responsive, ergonomic marvel under €12.50? Explore materials, mechanisms, and cost-saving hacks. Bring us prototypes — even if they look like donkeys right now. (No judgment.)\n\n🎯 **User Interface Designer** — Map the user journey. How many buttons? Where should they go? Should it glow? Be voice-activated? Think about accessibility, intuitiveness, and delight. Remember — simplicity is sophistication.\n\n🎯 **Marketing Expert** — Define the non-negotiables. What MUST a remote control have to sell? What features drive purchase decisions? What’s the emotional hook? And — yes — how do we market a remote that can survive a shower?\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Closing: Ignite the Spark, Own the Vision\n\nTeam — this isn’t just another project. It’s a chance to redefine what a remote control can be. To surprise users. To outshine competitors. To turn a mundane object into a moment of joy.\n\nWe’ve already begun with laughter, creativity, and bold ideas. Now, let’s channel that energy into execution.\n\nYou’ll receive follow-up emails with resources, timelines, and inspiration. But don’t wait for permission — start sketching, start prototyping, start dreaming.\n\nBecause the best products aren’t built in boardrooms — they’re born in moments like this: when we dare to ask, “What if?” — and then answer with action.\n\nLet’s make this remote control unforgettable.\n\nLet’s make it ours.\n\nThank you — now let’s get to work. 🚀\n\n---\n```\n\n> *Note: This speech balances humor, clarity, and momentum — honoring the playful spirit of the meeting while driving focus toward actionable goals. Perfect for rallying a cross-functional team around an ambitious product vision.*",

Not just any banana. The *essence* of bananas. So real, so tactile, so delightfully absurd that our UI designer confessed: *“I’d be confused if I saw this thing in my kitchen.”* And yet — here we are. Not laughing *at* it… but laughing *with* it. Because this isn’t just a quirky shape. It’s a symbol of what happens when creativity meets discipline, when fun meets function, and when a team dares to ask: *“What if?”*\n\nToday, we’re not just reviewing a product. We’re celebrating a milestone — one born from collaboration, tested by rigor, and validated by data. Let’s dive in.\n\n---\n\n## 📊 **Part 1: The Numbers Don’t Lie — Budget? Check.**\n\nWe began with cost — because let’s be honest, even the most beautiful banana needs to make financial sense.\n\nThe verdict? **€10.70** — well under our target of €12.50. That’s not just “good.” That’s *strategic*. That’s *profitable*. That’s *market-ready*.\n\nWhy does this matter? Because it means we can price this at **€25** — a sweet spot that makes it accessible, attractive, and still leaves room for growth. As our UI lead pointed out: *“Some banana-shaped phones sold for €200… and they were just phones!”* Ours? A tech-forward, rubber-spongy, wheel-equipped, lighting-capable marvel — for a fraction of the cost.\n\nThis isn’t luck. This is precision. This is teamwork. This is *winning*.\n\n---\n\n## 📈 **Part 2: Evaluation — How Did Our Banana Score?**\n\nNext up: the big test. Six criteria. Seven-point scale. No mercy. Just honesty.\n\nHere’s how our banana stacked up:\n\n### 🎨 **Fancy Look & Feel?**\n- **Average: 5.5/7**  \n  *“It’s very nice,”* said the PM.  \n  *“Five,”* said UI.  \n  *“Six,”* said Design.  \n  *“Six,”* said Marketing.  \n  → **Verdict:** Elegant. Unmistakable. A conversation starter. A design win.\n\n### ⚙️ **Technological Innovation?**\n- **Average: 4/7**  \n  The wheel? Yes. The rubber material? Yes. But beyond that? We agreed — *“not groundbreaking.”*  \n  → **Verdict:** Solid foundation. Room to innovate further. Let’s keep pushing.\n\n### 👐 **Easy to Use?**\n- **Average: 6.5/7**  \n  *“Seven!”* said UI.  \n  *“Seven!”* said PM.  \n  *“Six,”* said Design.  \n  *“Six,”* said Marketing.  \n  → **Verdict:** Intuitive. Accessible. Delightful. User-first design? Check.\n\n### 👗 **Fashion?**\n- **Average: 7/7**  \n  *“It’s a fruit shape — that’s fashion!”*  \n  *“Seven!”* — unanimous.  \n  → **Verdict:** Trendsetting. Bold. Unapologetically unique. You’ll see this on Instagram before you see it on shelves.\n\n### 🔍 **Easy to Find in a Room?**\n- **Average: 6.5/7**  \n  *“You can’t miss it,”* said PM.  \n  *“Lost my banana?”* joked Design.  \n  → **Verdict:** Bright yellow. Standout shape. Lighting potential? Yes. Visibility? Guaranteed.\n\n### 💪 **Robust?**\n- **Average: 6/7**  \n  Rubber casing = drop-proof charm. Sensitive? Maybe. But protected? Absolutely.  \n  → **Verdict:** Durable. Resilient. Built for real life — and real hands.\n\n---\n\n## 🏁 **Part 3: The Bottom Line — Why This Works**\n\nSo where do we stand?\n\n✅ **Cost?** Under budget. Profitable. Scalable.  \n✅ **Design?** Beautiful. Memorable. Functional.  \n✅ **User Experience?** Simple. Intuitive. Joyful.  \n✅ **Market Fit?** Fashion-forward. Tech-enabled. Affordable.  \n\nThis isn’t just a product. It’s a statement. A proof point. A beacon of what happens when we stop asking *“Is it possible?”* and start asking *“Why not?”*\n\nAnd yes — we joked about champagne. About eating bananas. About management watching us. But beneath the laughter? There’s truth: **This team delivered.**\n\n---\n\n## 🎉 **Closing: To the Future — Bigger Projects, Bigger Wins**\n\nTo our Industrial Designer — thank you for turning whimsy into form.  \nTo our UI Lead — thank you for grounding magic in usability.  \nTo Marketing — thank you for translating vision into value.  \nTo every voice in this room — thank you for showing up, speaking up, and believing in the banana.\n\nThis prototype? It’s more than foam and rubber. It’s a testament to collaboration. To courage. To creativity that refuses to be boxed in.\n\nSo as we wrap up — let’s not just celebrate this meeting. Let’s celebrate the next one. The bigger project. The higher stakes. The even wilder ideas.\n\nBecause if we can turn a banana into a business case… imagine what we’ll do next.\n\n**Thank you. Keep innovating. Keep laughing. And always — always — bring your bananas to work.**\n\n🍌 *Onward, upward, and deliciously forward!* 🍌\n\n--- \n\n> *P.S. — If anyone finds a real banana in the meeting room… it’s probably ours. Claim it. Eat it. Celebrate it.*"

    "llm_output_test3": "summary: <paper_summary>\n  <background>\n    Les modèles de langage à grande échelle (LLMs) sont généralement entraînés avec des volumes massifs de données pour maîtriser le raisonnement complexe, notamment en mathématiques. Cette approche repose sur l’hypothèse que des démonstrations supervisées nombreuses sont nécessaires pour apprendre à raisonner. Cependant, cette méthode est coûteuse en ressources et soulève des doutes sur la généralisation réelle plutôt que la mémorisation. Parallèlement, les progrès récents montrent que les LLMs modernes intègrent déjà une base de connaissances mathématiques étendue pendant la pré-formation, et que le calcul lors de l’inférence (test-time compute) peut activer ces capacités cognitives. Ce travail remet en question le paradigme « plus de données = meilleur raisonnement ».\n  </background>\n\n  <objectives>\n    L’objectif principal est de valider l’hypothèse « Less is More for Reasoning » (LIMO), selon laquelle un raisonnement sophistiqué peut émerger à partir de très peu d’exemples bien choisis, à condition que : (1) le modèle possède une base de connaissances pré-entraînée riche, et (2) les exemples servent de « templates cognitifs » guidant le processus de raisonnement. Les questions de recherche incluent : l’impact de la qualité des chaînes de raisonnement, de la difficulté des questions, du modèle de base, de la taille du modèle, et de la quantité minimale de données requise.\n  </objectives>\n\n  <methods>\n    L’équipe a construit un jeu de données LIMO de 800 échantillons hautement curatés, sélectionnés à partir d’un pool initial de millions de problèmes mathématiques. Le processus de curation implique : (1) un filtrage par difficulté via des modèles de référence ; (2) une évaluation de la qualité des chaînes de raisonnement selon quatre critères : raisonnement élaboré, auto-vérification, approche exploratoire, granularité adaptative ; (3) une pondération algorithmique de ces critères. Le modèle Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct a été finetuné avec ce jeu de données via un apprentissage supervisé (SFT), sans phase de warmup, avec ZeRO-3 et FlashAttention-2. Les performances ont été évaluées sur plusieurs benchmarks mathématiques (AIME24, MATH500, AMC23) et hors distribution (OlympiadBench, CHMath, Gaokao, etc.), en utilisant le métrique pass@1 en mode zero-shot CoT.\n  </methods>\n\n  <findings>\n    LIMO atteint 63,3 % sur AIME24 et 95,6 % sur MATH500 — surpassant les meilleurs modèles finetunés précédents (6,5 % et 59,2 % respectivement) tout en utilisant seulement 1 % des données d’entraînement. Sur les benchmarks hors distribution, LIMO obtient une amélioration moyenne de 45,8 % par rapport aux modèles entraînés sur 100x plus de données. Les analyses montrent que : (1) la qualité des chaînes de raisonnement (notamment niveau L5) est cruciale ; (2) des questions plus difficiles (ex. AIME) améliorent significativement les performances ; (3) le choix du modèle de base (Qwen2.5 vs Qwen1.5) influe fortement (+54 points sur AIME) ; (4) la taille du modèle aide (72B > 32B), mais avec des rendements décroissants ; (5) 800 échantillons suffisent pour des performances optimales — ajouter plus de données n’apporte que des gains marginaux.\n  </findings>\n\n  <implications>\n    Ce travail démontre que la quantité de données n’est pas le facteur déterminant pour le raisonnement complexe, mais plutôt la qualité des exemples et la richesse des connaissances pré-entraînées. L’hypothèse LIMO ouvre la voie à des méthodes d’apprentissage beaucoup plus efficaces, réduisant drastiquement les coûts computationnels et les besoins en données. Elle suggère que les LLMs peuvent être « activés » comme des raisonneurs grâce à des démonstrations stratégiques, plutôt que saturés de données. Ces résultats encouragent une réorientation vers la curation intelligente des données et l’optimisation du calcul à l’inférence. La communauté peut désormais explorer des approches similaires dans d’autres domaines cognitifs, avec des applications pratiques dans l’éducation, la recherche scientifique ou l’automatisation de tâches complexes.\n  </implications>\n</paper_summary>"

    "llm_output_test3": "summary: <paper_summary>\n  <background>\n    Les modèles linguistiques de grande taille (LLM) sont traditionnellement entraînés avec des volumes massifs de données pour développer des capacités de raisonnement complexe, notamment en mathématiques. Cette approche repose sur l’hypothèse que le raisonnement nécessite une exposition à des milliers, voire des centaines de milliers d’exemples supervisés. Cependant, cette méthode est coûteuse en ressources et soulève des questions sur la généralisation réelle versus la simple mémorisation. Les auteurs s’interrogent sur la pertinence de ce paradigme, en particulier à l’ère où les LLM modernes intègrent déjà une base de connaissances mathématiques vaste et riche durant leur pré-entraînement.\n  </background>\n\n  <objectives>\n    L’objectif principal est de valider l’hypothèse « Less Is More for Reasoning » (LIMO), selon laquelle un raisonnement sophistiqué peut émerger à partir d’un nombre très restreint d’exemples bien choisis, à condition que le modèle possède déjà une base de connaissances solide et que les exemples servent de « templates cognitifs ». Les questions de recherche incluent : (1) L’impact de la qualité des chaînes de raisonnement ; (2) L’influence de la difficulté des questions ; (3) Le rôle de la qualité du pré-entraînement ; (4) L’effet de la taille du modèle ; (5) La minimalité des données requises pour une performance compétitive.\n  </objectives>\n\n  <methods>\n    Les auteurs construisent un jeu de données LIMO composé de seulement 800 paires question-réponse, sélectionnées rigoureusement à partir d’une pool initiale de 2,125 problèmes. Le processus de curation implique : (1) Un filtrage multi-niveaux par difficulté (via des modèles comme Qwen2.5-Math-7B et DeepSeek-R1) ; (2) Une évaluation des chaînes de raisonnement selon quatre critères : raisonnement élaboré, auto-vérification, approche exploratoire et granularité adaptative, mesurés via un système de scoring basé sur des mots-clés pondérés. Le modèle de base, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, est finement ajusté via SFT (supervised fine-tuning) sur ce jeu de données. L’évaluation couvre des benchmarks en domaine (AIME24, MATH500, AMC23) et hors domaine (OlympiadBench, CHMath, Gaokao, GPQA, etc.), avec des métriques pass@1 en mode zero-shot CoT.\n  </methods>\n\n  <findings>\n    LIMO atteint 63,3 % sur AIME24 et 95,6 % sur MATH500 — surpassant tous les modèles comparés, y compris OpenAI-o1-preview et QwQ-32B-Preview — tout en utilisant 1 % des données d’entraînement des méthodes précédentes. Sur les benchmarks hors domaine, LIMO affiche une amélioration moyenne de 45,8 % par rapport aux modèles entraînés sur 100× plus de données. L’analyse montre que : (1) La qualité des chaînes de raisonnement est déterminante — les modèles entraînés sur les meilleures chaînes (L5) surpassent nettement ceux entraînés sur des chaînes de moindre qualité (L1) ; (2) Les questions plus difficiles (Advanced-500) améliorent significativement la performance ; (3) La qualité du pré-entraînement est cruciale — LIMO (basé sur Qwen2.5) surpasse Qwen1.5 de 54 points sur AIME24 ; (4) La taille du modèle influence la performance, mais avec des rendements décroissants au-delà de 32B ; (5) Seulement 400 exemples suffisent pour une amélioration massive, et 800 représentent un point de saturation optimal.\n  </findings>\n\n  <implications>\n    Ce travail remet en cause le dogme selon lequel le raisonnement complexe exige des volumes massifs de données. Il démontre qu’un apprentissage efficace repose davantage sur la qualité et la conception stratégique des exemples que sur leur quantité. L’hypothèse LIMO ouvre la voie à des méthodes d’entraînement plus économiques et écologiques, favorisant la diffusion de modèles performants dans des contextes à ressources limitées. Elle souligne aussi l’importance de la curation des données et de l’optimisation des chaînes de raisonnement pour activer les connaissances latentes des LLM. Enfin, elle invite à repenser les paradigmes d’alignement et de fine-tuning, en priorisant les \"templates cognitifs\" qui guident le raisonnement plutôt que la simple mémorisation de solutions.\n  </implications>\n</paper_summary>\nmethodology_analysis: <methodology_analysis>\n  <innovative_aspects>\n    La méthodologie de LIMO repose sur une hypothèse centrale novatrice : « Less is More for Reasoning ». Contrairement à l’approche dominante qui exige des milliers, voire des centaines de milliers d’exemples pour enseigner le raisonnement aux grands modèles linguistiques (LLMs), LIMO démontre qu’un jeu de données extrêmement réduit (800 échantillons) peut suffire si ces exemples sont soigneusement sélectionnés pour activer les connaissances latentes du modèle. L’originalité réside dans la combinaison de deux éléments : (1) une curation rigoureuse des questions et chaînes de raisonnement basée sur des métriques quantitatives (difficulté, vérification interne, exploration, granularité adaptative) ; (2) l’exploitation du fait que les LLMs modernes, pré-entraînés sur des corpus mathématiques massifs, possèdent déjà les connaissances nécessaires — il s’agit donc de les « éliciter » plutôt que de les apprendre. Cette approche remet en question le paradigme de l’apprentissage par volume et introduit un cadre systématique pour identifier les « templates cognitifs » optimaux.\n  </innovative_aspects>\n  <strengths>\n    La force principale de LIMO est sa robustesse empirique : malgré un jeu d’entraînement 100 fois plus petit que ceux utilisés par les modèles concurrents, LIMO surpasse significativement ses pairs sur des benchmarks variés (AIME24, MATH500, OlympiadBench, etc.), y compris hors distribution. La méthode de curation hiérarchisée — filtrage par difficulté, évaluation multi-modèle, scoring règles-based — assure une qualité élevée des données, ce qui se traduit par une généralisation remarquable. L’étude ablationnelle confirme l’impact critique de la qualité des chaînes de raisonnement et de la difficulté des questions. De plus, l’analyse comparative avec différents backbones (Qwen1.5 vs Qwen2.5) valide l’hypothèse selon laquelle la richesse du pré-entraînement conditionne l’efficacité de la fine-tuning minimaliste. Enfin, la transparence méthodologique — publication des données, code et modèles — renforce la reproductibilité et l’impact scientifique.\n  </strengths>\n  <limitations>\n    Plusieurs limites doivent être notées. Premièrement, la méthode repose fortement sur la qualité du modèle de base (Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct) ; elle pourrait ne pas se généraliser à des architectures ou pré-entraînements moins riches en mathématiques. Deuxièmement, bien que 800 échantillons soient suffisants, la méthode reste coûteuse en ressources humaines pour la curation manuelle et l’évaluation collaborative des chaînes de raisonnement — ce qui limite son scalabilité. Troisièmement, les résultats sont centrés sur le raisonnement mathématique ; leur transfert à d’autres domaines complexes (ex. : programmation, logique formelle) n’est pas démontré. Quatrièmement, l’utilisation de métriques basées sur des mots-clés (« check », « perhaps ») pour évaluer la qualité des chaînes reste simpliste et potentiellement biaisée. Enfin, bien que LIMO montre une saturation après 800 échantillons, l’optimalité absolue de cette taille n’est pas prouvée, et des stratégies d’apprentissage actif pourraient encore améliorer l’efficacité.\n  </limitations>\n</methodology_analysis>"

À partir d’un pool initial de millions de problèmes mathématiques, ils ont appliqué un filtrage multi-niveaux : élimination des problèmes triviaux via un modèle de base (Qwen2.5-Math-7B), puis sélection des plus difficiles via un modèle plus puissant (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B). Ensuite, ils ont généré plusieurs chaînes de raisonnement pour chaque problème, évaluées selon quatre critères : raisonnement élaboré, auto-vérification, approche exploratoire et granularité adaptative. Un système de notation basé sur des règles a permis de sélectionner les 800 meilleures paires question/raisonnement.

Il montre également une excellente généralisation hors distribution : +45,8 % d’amélioration absolue sur des benchmarks variés comme OlympiadBench, CHMath, Gaokao, Minerva et GPQA. L’analyse révèle que la qualité des chaînes de raisonnement est cruciale : les modèles entraînés sur les solutions les mieux notées (L5) surpassent nettement ceux entraînés sur des solutions médiocres (L1). De même, la difficulté des questions influence fortement la performance : un modèle entraîné sur des problèmes avancés (AIME) obtient 91,2 % sur MATH500 sans y avoir été exposé. La qualité du modèle de base (pré-entraînement) est déterminante : LIMO (basé sur Qwen2.5) dépasse Qwen1.5 de 54 points sur AIME24.

L’hypothèse LIMO ouvre la voie à des méthodes d’entraînement beaucoup plus efficaces en termes de données et de calcul. Elle suggère que l’avenir du raisonnement dans les LLM réside moins dans l’échelle des données que dans la conception intelligente des exemples d’apprentissage et l’exploitation des ressources computationnelles disponibles au moment de l’inférence. Ces résultats peuvent transformer les pratiques d’alignement et de fine-tuning, en favorisant la qualité plutôt que la quantité, et en rendant le développement de modèles raisonnants plus accessible et durable.\n  </implications>\n</paper_summary>\nmethodology_analysis: <methodology_analysis>\n  <innovative_aspects>\n    La méthodologie de LIMO repose sur une hypothèse centrale novatrice : « Less is More for Reasoning ». Contrairement à l’approche dominante qui exige des milliers, voire des centaines de milliers d’exemples pour enseigner le raisonnement aux grands modèles linguistiques (LLMs), LIMO démontre qu’un jeu de données extrêmement réduit (800 échantillons) peut suffire — à condition que ces exemples soient stratégiquement sélectionnés. L’innovation réside dans la curation rigoureuse des données, combinant un filtrage multi-niveaux par difficulté et une évaluation quantitative des chaînes de raisonnement selon des critères cognitifs (auto-vérification, exploration, granularité adaptative).

La méthodologie est systématique et reproductible, avec un pipeline clairement documenté de sélection des questions et des chaînes de raisonnement. Les analyses ablatives (RQ1 à RQ5) confirment l’impact des facteurs clés : qualité des chaînes, difficulté des questions, richesse de la pré-formation et taille du modèle.

Enfin, la publication des données, du code et des modèles renforce la transparence et favorise la recherche future.\n  </strengths>\n  <limitations>\n    Malgré ses succès, la méthode présente plusieurs limites. Premièrement, elle dépend fortement de la qualité de la pré-formation du modèle : les résultats spectaculaires ne sont observés que sur Qwen2.5, dont la base de données mathématique est supérieure à celle de Qwen1.5. Cela suggère que LIMO n’est pas universellement applicable à tous les LLMs. Deuxièmement, la sélection manuelle des chaînes de raisonnement, bien que structurée, reste coûteuse en main-d’œuvre et difficilement extensible à d’autres domaines. Troisièmement, la performance sur des tâches hors distribution (OOD) est impressionnante mais reste limitée à des contextes mathématiques ou STEM ; on ignore si elle se généralise à des raisonnements non formels ou à des domaines qualitatifs. Enfin, bien que 800 échantillons soient peu nombreux, ils ont été extraits d’un pool initial de 2 125 problèmes, ce qui implique un coût préalable de curation important. La méthode pourrait souffrir de biais si le pool initial était mal couvert ou non représentatif.\n  </limitations>\n</methodology_analysis>\nevaluation: <critical_evaluation>\n  <research_background>\n    Ce travail s’inscrit dans un débat fondamental de l’apprentissage profond : la nécessité ou non d’une masse critique de données supervisées pour développer des capacités de raisonnement. Les auteurs remettent en cause le paradigme dominant — selon lequel les LLMs doivent être entraînés sur des dizaines ou centaines de milliers d’exemples pour acquérir une logique complexe — en proposant une hypothèse radicalement différente : « Less-Is-More Reasoning ». Leur motivation est double : réduire les coûts computationnels et énergétiques liés à l’entraînement massif, tout en explorant la véritable nature du raisonnement émergent dans les modèles déjà riches en connaissances. Cette position est particulièrement pertinente à l’ère des LLMs pré-entraînés sur des corpus encyclopédiques, où la question n’est plus tant d’injecter des connaissances que d’activer des schémas cognitifs. Le cadre théorique est bien ancré dans les recherches récentes sur l’efficacité des exemples de fine-tuning (comme les travaux sur les \"in-context learning\" ou les \"chain-of-thought prompts\"), mais il va plus loin en formalisant une méthodologie systématique de curation.\n  </research_background>\n\n  <contributions>\n    La principale contribution de ce papier est l’élaboration et la validation empirique de l’hypothèse LIMO, qui démontre qu’un petit jeu de données (800 exemples) peut suffire à activer des capacités de raisonnement sophistiquées — à condition que ces exemples soient de haute qualité, difficiles et structurés selon des critères cognitifs précis. Cette découverte a un impact théorique majeur : elle suggère que le raisonnement n’est pas appris par accumulation, mais activé par des déclencheurs stratégiques. Sur le plan pratique, la méthode LIMO propose un pipeline reproductible de sélection de données, utilisant des modèles comme outils de curation, ce qui pourrait inspirer des approches similaires dans d’autres domaines. Enfin, les résultats quantitatifs sont impressionnants : des performances supérieures à celles de modèles entraînés sur 100x plus de données, avec une excellente généralisation hors distribution. Ces contributions ont le potentiel de transformer les pratiques de fine-tuning, en recentrant l’attention sur la qualité plutôt que la quantité.\n  </contributions>\n\n  <strengths>\n    La force majeure de cette étude réside dans sa rigueur méthodologique et sa robustesse empirique.

Les analyses ablatives (RQ1 à RQ5) fournissent des preuves solides que chaque composant — qualité des templates, difficulté des questions, richesse du modèle de base — joue un rôle déterminant. L’utilisation de benchmarks variés (mathématiques, Olympiades, Gaokao, GPQA) renforce la validité externe des résultats. De plus, la transparence totale (code, données, modèles publiés) est exemplaire et favorise la reproduction et l’extension de l’étude. Enfin, le résultat surprenant — un modèle finetuné sur 800 exemples surpassant des modèles entraînés sur 100 000+ — est non seulement statistiquement significatif, mais aussi conceptuellement provocateur, invitant à repenser les fondements de l’apprentissage par exemple.\n  </strengths>\n\n  <weaknesses>\n    Malgré ses atouts, l’étude présente plusieurs limites importantes. Premièrement, son efficacité semble fortement dépendante de la qualité du modèle de base : les résultats spectaculaires ne sont observés que sur Qwen2.5, dont la base mathématique est supérieure à celle de Qwen1.5. Cela soulève des questions sur la généralisabilité de LIMO à d’autres architectures ou domaines. Deuxièmement, la méthode reste coûteuse en ressources humaines et computationnelles pour la curation initiale — même si le jeu final est petit, il provient d’un pool initial de 2 125 problèmes filtrés par des modèles puissants. Troisièmement, la généralisation hors distribution est impressionnante, mais se limite aux domaines formels (mathématiques, STEM). On ignore si LIMO fonctionne pour des raisonnements qualitatifs, éthiques ou contextuels. Enfin, le biais potentiel du pool initial de données n’est pas analysé : si celui-ci est mal couvert ou non représentatif, les résultats pourraient être artificiellement gonflés.\n  </weaknesses>\n\n  <future_directions>\n    Plusieurs pistes prometteuses méritent d’être explorées. D’abord, tester LIMO sur d’autres domaines (droit, médecine, philosophie) pour évaluer sa généralisabilité au-delà du raisonnement formel. Ensuite, automatiser davantage la curation des chaînes de raisonnement via des agents LLM autonomes, afin de réduire la dépendance à la main-d’œuvre humaine. Un troisième axe serait d’intégrer LIMO dans des pipelines d’apprentissage continu ou d’auto-amélioration, où les modèles génèrent eux-mêmes leurs propres exemples de haute qualité. Enfin, explorer l’impact de la diversité culturelle ou linguistique des exemples sélectionnés, afin de garantir une robustesse équitable. À terme, LIMO pourrait inspirer une nouvelle génération de méthodes d’alignement centrées sur la qualité des démonstrations plutôt que sur la quantité des données — rendant le développement de modèles raisonnants plus accessible, durable et scientifiquement fondé.\n  </future_directions>\n</critical_evaluation>"

Methodology Analysis\n\n<methodology_analysis>\n  <innovative_aspects>\n    本文提出LLaDA（Large Language Diffusion with mAsking），是首个从零训练、规模达8B参数的离散扩散语言模型，挑战了当前大语言模型（LLM）必须依赖自回归建模（ARM）的主流范式。其核心创新在于采用“掩码扩散模型”（MDM），通过前向随机掩码与反向预测过程构建双向依赖的生成分布，而非单向token预测。该方法在理论层面严格优化似然下界，具备最大似然估计的理论基础，区别于MaskGIT等启发式方法。此外，LLaDA首次在大规模语言建模中验证扩散模型可实现上下文学习、指令跟随与数学推理等核心能力，并在“反转诗歌补全”任务中超越GPT-4o，突破传统ARM的“反转诅咒”瓶颈。\n  </innovative_aspects>\n  <strengths>\n    方法论上，LLaDA架构兼容标准Transformer，无需因果掩码，支持灵活采样策略（如纯扩散、块扩散、自回归），且无需额外训练即可切换。预训练与SFT流程标准化，数据处理、超参设置透明，确保实验可复现。实证方面，LLaDA 8B在多个基准（MMLU、GSM8K、HumanEval等）表现媲美LLaMA3 8B，尤其在中文与数学任务上优势明显。其双向建模特性赋予模型更强的结构泛化能力，如在反转推理任务中表现卓越。采样效率方面，LLaDA支持步数调节，在保持质量前提下提升吞吐量（如GSM8K上比LLaMA3快1.5倍）。此外，模型对生成长度不敏感，具备良好的鲁棒性。\n  </strengths>\n  <limitations>\n    首先，LLaDA仍受限于计算资源，未与同规模ARM进行完全公平对比（如未训练8B ARM基线），其FLOPs成本可能高于ARM。其次，推理阶段未引入KV缓存或系统级优化，导致内存占用略高，采样速度尚未达到最优。第三，模型未结合强化学习对齐（RLHF），指令跟随能力虽强但弱于经RL优化的模型（如LLaMA3 Instruct）。第四，生成长度需手动设定，缺乏自适应机制；且在SFT数据中大量填充EOS标记，影响采样稳定性，需人工干预置信度调整。最后，论文未探索多模态扩展或更复杂后训练策略（如O1类系统），潜力尚未完全释放。\n  </limitations>\n</methodology_analysis>\n\n---\n\n## 3. Critical Evaluation\n\n<critical_evaluation>\n  <research_background>\n    本文立足于当前大语言模型（LLM）高度依赖自回归建模（ARM）的主流范式，敏锐指出其在逆向推理、双向依赖建模等方面的固有缺陷，如“逆向诅咒”问题。作者以扩散模型在视觉领域的成功为启发，大胆质疑“ARM是LLM能力基础”的默认假设，提出从零构建基于掩码扩散的语言模型——LLaDA。该研究定位清晰，直指生成建模本质而非结构形式，具有强烈的理论挑战性和技术前瞻性。在当前LLM架构同质化严重的背景下，本文为探索非自回归路径提供了关键突破口，推动领域从“如何优化ARM”转向“是否必须依赖ARM”，具有重要的范式革新意义。\n  </research_background>\n\n  <contributions>\n    本文的核心贡献在于首次成功训练出8B参数规模的离散扩散语言模型，并系统验证其具备与ARM基线相当甚至超越的通用能力（如上下文学习、指令跟随、数学推理），尤其在逆向任务中显著优于GPT-4o，有力证明了扩散模型可作为LLM的可行替代架构。理论层面，LLaDA严格优化变分下界，区别于MaskGIT等启发式方法，具备坚实的统计建模基础。实践上，其支持灵活采样策略、无需因果掩码、对生成长度鲁棒，展现出独特工程优势。该工作不仅拓展了语言建模的技术边界，更引发学界对“生成能力本质”的重新思考，为后续非自回归LLM研究开辟了新方向。\n  </contributions>\n\n  <strengths>\n    方法设计严谨，架构兼容标准Transformer，训练流程标准化（预训练+SFT），实验可复现性强；实证结果全面，在MMLU、GSM8K、中文任务等多个基准上表现优异，尤其在需要双向推理的任务中展现结构性优势。采样效率高，支持质量-速度权衡调节，部分任务吞吐量超LLaMA3 1.5倍，体现实用潜力。创新性突出：首次将扩散模型扩展至8B规模并实现完整LLM能力闭环，突破传统ARM瓶颈，如“诗句倒序补全”任务中的卓越表现即为典型例证。此外，模型无需额外训练即可切换采样模式，灵活性强，便于部署与调优。\n  </strengths>\n\n  <weaknesses>\n    尽管成果显著，仍存在若干关键局限：首先，未与同等规模ARM模型进行完全公平对比（如未训练8B ARM基线），且FLOPs成本可能更高，削弱了效率优势的说服力。其次，推理阶段缺乏KV缓存或系统级优化，内存占用高、采样速度未达最优，影响实际部署可行性。第三，未引入RLHF对齐，导致指令遵循能力虽强但弱于经强化学习优化的模型（如LLaMA3 Instruct），限制其在对话场景的竞争力。第四，生成长度需手动设定，缺乏自适应机制；SFT数据中EOS填充过多，影响采样稳定性，需人工干预置信度重掩码，降低自动化程度。最后，未探索多模态或复杂后训练策略（如O1类系统），模型潜力尚未充分释放。\n  </weaknesses>\n\n  <future_directions>\n    未来研究应聚焦以下方向：1）构建公平对比实验，训练同规模ARM基线并量化FLOPs/能耗/延迟，明确扩散模型的性价比；2）引入KV缓存、流式采样、自适应步长控制等系统优化，提升推理效率与内存利用率；3）集成RLHF或DPO等对齐技术，增强指令跟随与安全性，缩小与主流Instruct模型的差距；4）开发自适应生成长度机制，减少人工干预，提升采样稳定性；5）探索多模态扩展（如图文联合建模），验证扩散架构在跨模态任务中的泛化能力；6）研究扩散模型在长文本、结构化输出、逻辑链推理等复杂场景的应用潜力，推动其从“替代方案”走向“主导架构”。此外，建议开源模型与训练代码，促进社区协作，加速非自回归LLM生态发展。\n  </future_directions>\n</critical_evaluation>\n\n---\n\n*Report generated by Academic Paper Analysis Workflow*",

Paper Summary\n\n<paper_summary>\n  <background>\n    現代の言語エージェントは、外部情報の取得、観測への適応、相互依存的なクエリへの回答など、長期間にわたるマルチターンの対話が必要なタスクを処理する。しかし、既存のLLMシステムは過去のすべての対話履歴を文脈に追加する「フルコンテキストプロンプティング」に依存しており、メモリ使用量が無制限に増加し、計算コストが高騰、分布外の長い入力に対する推論性能が低下する問題がある。特に、研究支援やウェブナビゲーションといった現実的なマルチターンタスクでは、効率的かつスケーラブルなメモリ管理が求められている。\n  </background>\n  <objectives>\n    本研究の目的は、長期間のマルチターンタスクにおいて定常的なメモリ使用量を維持しながら、効率的かつ高性能な言語エージェントを学習させるためのフレームワーク「MEM1」を開発することである。具体的には、(1) 推論とメモリ統合を統一した内部状態で行うことで、不要な情報を戦略的に破棄し、メモリ使用量を一定に保つこと。(2) リンクされた複数の質問からなる多目的タスクを構築することで、より現実的な訓練環境を提供すること。(3) 強化学習（RL）を用いて、報酬信号を通じてメモリ管理を政策として学習させること。\n  </objectives>\n  <methods>\n    MEM1は、各ターンで新しい観測と以前のメモリを統合した「内部状態（<IS>）」を更新する。この状態は思考と記憶を融合させ、前ターンの内容を削除してメモリを圧縮する。学習には強化学習（PPO）を用い、正解を導くために必要な情報のみを保持・統合するよう報酬設計している。また、単一目的のQAデータセット（HotpotQA, Natural Questions）を組み合わせて「多目的QAタスク」を構築し、最大16目標までの複雑なタスクで評価。メモリ統合時の注意マスクを2次元で適用し、過去のトークンへのアクセスを制限することで、ポリシー勾配の正確な計算を可能にしている。\n  </methods>\n  <findings>\n    実験結果では、MEM1-7BはQwen2.5-14B-Instructに対して、16目標のマルチホップQAタスクで性能を3.5倍向上させつつ、メモリ使用量を3.7倍削減した。WebShopでのショッピングタスクでも、AgentLM-7Bを上回る性能と、ピークトークン使用量を2.8倍削減。ゼロショット転移でもオンラインWeb-QA環境で高い効率性を示した。さらに、SFT（教師あり微調整）よりもRLによる学習の方が汎化性能が高く、6目標以上ではSFTモデルが性能崩壊を起こす一方、RLモデルは安定して動作。フォーマット報酬を導入すると収束が早くなるが最終性能は低下し、柔軟な推論戦略の探索が阻害される傾向も確認。\n  </findings>\n  <implications>\n    MEM1は、従来の「全履歴保存型」アプローチに代わる、推論駆動型メモリ統合という新しいパラダイムを提示した。これにより、長期間の対話タスクにおいて、メモリ使用量と推論遅延を大幅に削減しつつ、性能を維持または向上させることが可能になった。特に、GPUメモリが限られた環境や大規模なリアルワールドタスク（研究支援、カスタマーサポート、教育）において、より持続可能でスケーラブルなAIエージェントの実装を促進する。今後の課題として、報酬構造が曖昧なオープンエンドタスクへの拡張や、人間の認知プロセスとの類似性を活かしたさらなる最適化が挙げられる。\n  </implications>\n</paper_summary>\n\n---\n\n## 2. Methodology Analysis\n\n<methodology_analysis>\n  <innovative_aspects>\n    MEM1の最大の革新点は、推論プロセスとメモリ統合を「内部状態（IS）」という単一の表現空間に統合し、エージェントが各ターンで過去の情報を圧縮・更新するように学習させる点にある。従来の多ターンエージェントは、履歴を逐次追加するため文脈長が無制限に増大するが、MEM1はXMLタグ（<IS>、<query>、<info>）を用いて、直近の情報のみを保持する構造を採用。これにより、メモリ使用量をほぼ一定に保ちつつ、効率的な長期的推論を実現。さらに、強化学習（RL）を通じて「記憶の選択的保持」を暗黙的に最適化し、外部メモリモジュールや別個の要約モデルを必要としない。また、既存の単一目的QAデータセットを組み合わせて「多目的タスク」を構築する手法も独創的であり、より現実的な長期インタラクション環境を再現可能。\n  </innovative_aspects>\n  <strengths>\n    本手法の強みは、効率性と汎化性能の両立にある。実験では、Qwen2.5-14B-Instructに対し、16目的タスクで3.5倍のパフォーマンス向上と3.7倍のメモリ削減を達成。特にピークトークン数と推論時間の低減は、GPUリソースの節約と実運用におけるスケーラビリティ向上に直結。RLによる訓練は、SFT（教師あり微調整）よりも複雑なタスクへの汎化能力が高く、8～16目的タスクでも性能が崩壊しない。また、2Dアテンションマスクを用いたポリシー最適化により、動的な文脈更新下でも安定した学習が可能。さらに、WebShopやオンライン検索など異なるドメインでの有効性も実証されており、汎用性が高い。\n  </strengths>\n  <limitations>\n    一方で、いくつかの制約がある。第一に、報酬設計が明確なタスク（例：正確な回答、特定行動の達成）に依存しており、曖昧な報酬構造を持つ開放的タスク（例：創造的対話、倫理的判断）への適用は困難。第二に、内部状態の更新がモデルの自己判断に委ねられており、誤った情報の蓄積や重要度の誤評価リスクが残る。第三に、実装上、位置IDの不整合によるアテンションマスクの近似処理が行われており、理論的には最適な注意重みを再現できていない。第四に、トレーニングには高コストなRLが必要であり、SFTや転移学習との比較で計算リソースの負担が大きい。最後に、人間の「記憶戦略」を模倣しているとはいえ、その認知的根拠や解釈可能性については今後の研究課題。\n  </limitations>\n</methodology_analysis>\n\n---\n\n## 3. Critical Evaluation\n\n<critical_evaluation>\n  <research_background>\n    本研究は、長期間マルチターン対話におけるメモリ管理の課題に焦点を当てており、現代のLLMエージェントが直面する「文脈爆発」と「推論性能の劣化」問題に対して、明確かつ現実的な動機を有している。特に、研究支援やウェブナビゲーションといった実用的タスクにおいて、従来のフルコンテキストプロンプティングの非効率性が顕在化しており、その限界に対する代替アプローチの必要性は極めて高い。本研究は、この分野における重要な空白を埋めるものであり、単なる最適化ではなく、「推論駆動型メモリ統合」という新しいパラダイムを提示することで、言語エージェント設計の方向性を根本的に再考させている点で、学術的・実用的意義が大きい。\n  </research_background>\n\n  <contributions>\n    本研究の最大の貢献は、「内部状態（IS）」という統一された表現空間を導入し、推論と記憶更新を同時に行うことで、定常的なメモリ使用量を維持しつつ高性能を達成した点にある。これは、外部要約モジュールや別個のメモリアーキテクチャを不要とする画期的な設計である。さらに、既存データセットを組み合わせた「多目的QAタスク」の構築により、より複雑な現実世界のシナリオを模倣可能となり、評価環境の現実性を高めた。強化学習（PPO）を用いて報酬信号に基づき「記憶の選択的保持」を暗黙的に学習させる点も独創的であり、人間の認知的戦略に近い柔軟なメモリ管理を実現している。これらの貢献は、スケーラブルかつ効率的なAIエージェントの実装を促進するだけでなく、長期対話システムの設計原則に新たな指針を与える。\n  </contributions>\n\n  <strengths>\n    最大の強みは、メモリ効率性と推論性能の両立にある。実験結果では、16目標タスクでQwen2.5-14B-Instructを3.5倍上回り、メモリ使用量を3.7倍削減したことは非常に印象的であり、GPUリソース制約下での実用性を示す。RLによる訓練はSFTよりも汎化性能が優れており、8～16目標の複雑タスクでも安定動作を保つ点は、実運用における信頼性を高める。また、WebShopやオンライン検索など異なるドメインでの有効性が実証されており、汎用性が高い。2D注意マスクの導入により、ポリシー勾配の安定計算が可能となり、動的な文脈更新下でも学習が収束しやすい構造になっていることも技術的強みである。\n  </strengths>\n\n  <weaknesses>\n    一方で、いくつかの課題が残る。第一に、報酬設計が明確な正解や行動基準に依存しており、創造的対話や倫理的判断など曖昧な報酬構造を持つオープンエンドタスクへの適用は困難である。第二に、内部状態の更新がモデル自身の判断に委ねられており、誤情報の蓄積や重要度の誤評価リスクが存在する。第三に、位置IDの不整合によるアテンションマスクの近似処理が行われており、理論的には最適な注意重みを再現できていない可能性がある。第四に、RLトレーニングには高コストが伴い、SFTや転移学習と比較して計算リソース負担が大きい。最後に、人間の記憶戦略との類似性については説明的根拠が薄く、解釈可能性や認知的妥当性の検証が今後の課題である。\n  </weaknesses>\n\n  <future_directions>\n    今後の研究では、以下の方向性が有望である。(1) 報酬設計の柔軟化：曖昧なタスクに対応するため、人間のフィードバックや自己評価を組み込んだ報酬関数の開発。(2) 記憶の信頼性向上：誤情報の蓄積を防ぐため、外部知識ベースとの連携や、記憶の信頼度スコアリング機構の導入。(3) 解釈性の強化：内部状態の更新過程を可視化・分析するための認知的モデルとの統合。(4) 計算効率の改善：RLの代わりに、擬似的な報酬信号を用いた効率的な微調整手法の探索。(5) 認知科学との融合：人間の記憶戦略（例：忘却、再構成）をより忠実に模倣するための神経科学的知見の活用。これらの取り組みにより、MEM1はより安全で汎用的、かつ人間中心のAIエージェントへと進化する可能性がある。\n  </future_directions>\n</critical_evaluation>\n\n---\n\n*Report generated by Academic Paper Analysis Workflow*",

Paper Summary\n\n<paper_summary>\n  <background>\n    Les modèles linguistiques de grande taille (LLM) sont traditionnellement entraînés sur des volumes massifs de données pour développer des capacités de raisonnement complexe, notamment en mathématiques. Cette approche repose sur l’hypothèse que le raisonnement nécessite une exposition à des milliers, voire des centaines de milliers d’exemples supervisés. Cependant, cette méthode est coûteuse en ressources et soulève des questions sur la généralisation réelle versus la simple mémorisation. Des avancées récentes suggèrent que les LLM modernes, grâce à un pré-entraînement riche en connaissances mathématiques et à des techniques d’inférence améliorées (comme les chaînes de raisonnement prolongées), pourraient activer leurs capacités cognitives avec bien moins de données — si celles-ci sont soigneusement sélectionnées.\n  </background>\n\n  <objectives>\n    Ce travail vise à tester l’hypothèse « Less is More for Reasoning » (LIMO) : dans les modèles dont les connaissances de base sont déjà riches, un raisonnement sophistiqué peut émerger à partir d’un très petit nombre d’exemples stratégiquement choisis. Les objectifs spécifiques incluent :\n    - Valider que 800 exemples de haute qualité suffisent à surpasser des modèles entraînés sur 100 000+ exemples.\n    - Identifier les facteurs clés qui déterminent l’efficacité de ces exemples : qualité des chaînes de raisonnement et difficulté des problèmes.\n    - Évaluer l’impact du modèle de base (pré-entraînement) et de sa taille.\n    - Mesurer la robustesse de la méthode sur des tâches hors distribution (OOD).\n  </objectives>\n\n  <methods>\n    L’équipe a construit un jeu de données LIMO de 800 échantillons via un processus rigoureux :\n    1. **Sélection de questions** : À partir d’un pool initial de millions de problèmes mathématiques (NuminaMath, AIME, MATH, etc.), filtration par difficulté (utilisation de modèles comme Qwen2.5-Math-7B et DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B pour identifier les problèmes non triviaux).\n    2. **Curation des chaînes de raisonnement** : Pour chaque problème, plusieurs solutions générées par des modèles de pointe (DeepSeek R1, QwQ-32B) ont été évaluées selon quatre critères : raisonnement élaboré, auto-vérification, approche exploratoire et granularité adaptative. Un système de notation basé sur des mots-clés a permis de classer et sélectionner les meilleures solutions.\n    3. **Entraînement** : Fine-tuning supervisé (SFT) du modèle Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct sur ce jeu de données restreint, avec optimisation DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 et FlashAttention-2, sans phase de warmup, pendant 15 époques.\n    4. **Évaluation** : Tests sur des benchmarks en domaine (AIME24, MATH500, AMC23) et hors domaine (OlympiadBench, CHMath, Gaokao, Minerva, GPQA), utilisant le métrique pass@1 en mode zero-shot CoT.\n  </methods>\n\n  <findings>\n    - **Performance supérieure avec peu de données** : LIMO atteint 63,3 % sur AIME24 et 95,6 % sur MATH500, surpassant tous les modèles finetunés précédents (ex. : NuminaMath-100k à 6,5 % sur AIME24) malgré l’utilisation de seulement 1 % des données.\n    - **Généralisation hors domaine exceptionnelle** : LIMO obtient 67,6 % sur OlympiadBench, 84,2 % sur CHMath, 91,1 % sur Gaokao — soit des gains absolus de +45,8 % comparé aux modèles entraînés sur 100x plus de données.\n    - **Impact de la qualité des données** : Des chaînes de raisonnement de haute qualité (notées L5) conduisent à des performances nettement supérieures à celles issues de chaînes de faible qualité (L1).\n    - **Rôle du pré-entraînement** : Le choix du modèle de base est crucial : LIMO (basé sur Qwen2.5) dépasse Qwen1.5 de 54 points sur AIME24, confirmant que la richesse des connaissances encodées au pré-entraînement est fondamentale.\n    - **Taille du modèle** : La performance augmente avec la taille (de 3B à 72B), mais les gains diminuent au-delà de 32B, suggérant un point de saturation.\n    - **Efficacité échantillonnage** : Déjà avec 400 échantillons, LIMO bat le modèle de base ; au-delà de 800, les gains deviennent marginaux.\n  </findings>\n\n  <implications>\n    Ce travail remet en question le paradigme dominant selon lequel le raisonnement complexe nécessite des quantités massives de données. Il démontre que, dans les modèles déjà riches en connaissances, la qualité et la conception stratégique des exemples sont bien plus importantes que leur nombre. L’hypothèse LIMO ouvre la voie à des méthodes d’entraînement beaucoup plus efficaces, réduisant drastiquement les coûts computationnels tout en améliorant la généralisation. Ces résultats pourraient transformer la manière dont on développe les capacités de raisonnement des LLM, en privilégiant la curation intelligente plutôt que la scalabilité brute. L’approche pourrait être étendue à d’autres domaines exigeant un raisonnement structuré (programmation, logique formelle, sciences).

Methodology Analysis\n\n<methodology_analysis>\n  <innovative_aspects>\n    La méthodologie de LIMO repose sur l’hypothèse « Less-Is-More » : des raisonnements complexes peuvent émerger à partir d’un très petit nombre d’exemples (800 seulement), à condition qu’ils soient stratégiquement sélectionnés pour activer les connaissances latentes du modèle. Cette approche remet en cause le paradigme dominant selon lequel les tâches de raisonnement nécessitent des milliers ou dizaines de milliers d’exemples. L’innovation réside dans la combinaison de deux éléments : (1) une curation rigoureuse des données basée sur des critères qualitatifs (difficulté, clarté du raisonnement, auto-vérification, granularité adaptative) et (2) l’exploitation de la capacité des modèles pré-entraînés à mobiliser leurs connaissances via des chaînes de raisonnement détaillées, même avec un finetuning minimal. Le cadre expérimental inclut également une analyse systématique des facteurs clés (qualité des questions, qualité des chaînes, taille du modèle, quantité de données), ce qui apporte une compréhension fine des mécanismes sous-jacents.\n  </innovative_aspects>\n  <strengths>\n    La force principale de LIMO est sa rigueur méthodologique dans la sélection des données : chaque question et chaque chaîne de raisonnement est évaluée par un système de notation règles-based, garantissant une qualité élevée et cohérente. Les résultats expérimentaux sont impressionnants : LIMO dépasse des modèles entraînés sur 100x plus de données, notamment sur AIME24 (63,3 % vs 6,5 %) et MATH500 (95,6 % vs 59,2 %). La généralisation hors distribution (OOD) est également remarquable, avec des gains significatifs sur des benchmarks multilingues et multidisciplinaires. L’approche est reproductible grâce à la publication des données, du code et des modèles. Enfin, les analyses ablatives fournissent des insights précieux sur l’impact relatif de la qualité des données, de la difficulté des questions et de la richesse du pré-entraînement — ce qui renforce la validité de l’hypothèse centrale.\n  </strengths>\n  <limitations>\n    Bien que prometteuse, la méthode présente plusieurs limites. Premièrement, elle dépend fortement de la qualité du modèle de base (Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct) ; les performances sur Qwen1.5 sont nettement inférieures, ce qui suggère que la méthode n’est pas universellement applicable à tous les LLMs. Deuxièmement, la construction du jeu de données LIMO requiert un effort humain important (curation manuelle, annotation collaborative), ce qui limite son évolutivité. Troisièmement, les résultats sur des benchmarks comme GPQA restent inférieurs à ceux d’OpenAI-o1, indiquant que certains types de raisonnement complexe nécessitent peut-être davantage de données ou des techniques différentes. Enfin, bien que les gains soient observés jusqu’à 800 échantillons, l’étude ne teste pas systématiquement des jeux encore plus petits (par exemple 100 ou 200), ce qui pourrait nuancer l’affirmation de “minimal data”. Une exploration plus poussée des seuils minimaux serait utile pour confirmer la robustesse de l’hypothèse.\n  </limitations>\n</methodology_analysis>\n\n---\n\n## 3. Critical Evaluation\n\n<critical_evaluation>\n  <research_background>\n    Ce travail s’inscrit dans un débat fondamental en apprentissage automatique : faut-il privilégier la quantité ou la qualité des données pour développer des capacités de raisonnement chez les modèles linguistiques ? Alors que la communauté a longtemps adopté une stratégie d’échelle massive — entraîner sur des dizaines ou centaines de milliers d’exemples —, ce papier propose une contre-hypothèse audacieuse : « Less is More for Reasoning » (LIMO). Cette position est bien motivée par les coûts croissants et les limites de généralisation observées dans les approches traditionnelles. L’auteur contextualise son travail en s’appuyant sur des avancées récentes montrant que les LLM modernes, déjà riches en connaissances grâce à leur pré-entraînement, peuvent activer des capacités cognitives complexes avec très peu d’exemples — à condition qu’ils soient stratégiquement choisis. Le cadre théorique repose donc sur une vision plus fine du rôle des données : non pas comme source de connaissances, mais comme déclencheur de mécanismes latents. Cela place l’étude au cœur des tendances actuelles visant à rendre l’apprentissage plus efficace, moins coûteux et plus interprétable.\n  </research_background>\n\n  <contributions>\n    Les contributions de cette étude sont multiples et significatives. Premièrement, elle fournit une preuve empirique robuste que 800 exemples de haute qualité suffisent à surpasser des modèles entraînés sur 100 000+ échantillons, remettant en cause le paradigme dominant de la scalabilité brute. Deuxièmement, elle introduit une méthodologie rigoureuse de curation basée sur quatre critères qualitatifs (raisonnement élaboré, auto-vérification, exploration, granularité), offrant un cadre reproductible pour sélectionner des données optimales. Troisièmement, elle met en lumière le rôle central du modèle de base : la richesse du pré-entraînement est déterminante, ce qui oriente la recherche vers la conception de modèles mieux pré-entraînés plutôt que vers la collecte de plus de données. Enfin, les résultats impressionnants sur des benchmarks hors distribution (OOD) démontrent une capacité de généralisation exceptionnelle, ouvrant la voie à des applications dans des domaines variés. La publication des données, du code et des modèles renforce encore la valeur scientifique de cette contribution.\n  </contributions>\n\n  <strengths>\n    La force majeure de ce travail réside dans sa rigueur méthodologique. La construction du jeu de données LIMO est minutieusement documentée, avec une évaluation systématique des chaînes de raisonnement via un système de notation règles-based, garantissant une qualité cohérente. Les résultats expérimentaux sont convaincants : des gains de +45,8 % sur OlympiadBench et une performance supérieure sur AIME24 (63,3 % vs 6,5 %) montrent clairement l’efficacité de l’approche. L’analyse ablatives — comparant l’impact de la qualité des chaînes, de la difficulté des problèmes, de la taille du modèle et de la quantité de données — apporte une compréhension fine des facteurs clés. La reproductibilité est assurée par la mise à disposition des ressources, ce qui favorise l’adoption et l’extension de la méthode. Enfin, la généralisation hors domaine est remarquable, soulignant la robustesse de l’approche face à des tâches inédites.\n  </strengths>\n\n  <weaknesses>\n    Malgré ses forces, l’étude présente quelques limites importantes. D’abord, sa dépendance au modèle de base (Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct) limite sa généralité : les performances chutent drastiquement sur Qwen1.5, suggérant que LIMO ne fonctionne que sur des modèles spécifiquement pré-entraînés pour le raisonnement mathématique. Ensuite, la curation manuelle des données, bien que rigoureuse, est coûteuse en main-d’œuvre et difficilement évolutible à grande échelle. Troisièmement, les résultats sur GPQA restent inférieurs à ceux d’OpenAI-o1, indiquant que certains types de raisonnement (ex. : multidisciplinaire ou nécessitant des connaissances externes) ne sont pas encore pleinement couverts. Enfin, l’étude ne teste pas systématiquement des jeux de données encore plus petits (100 ou 200 échantillons), ce qui pourrait affaiblir l’affirmation de minimalisme. Une analyse plus fine des seuils minimaux serait nécessaire pour confirmer la robustesse de l’hypothèse LIMO.\n  </weaknesses>\n\n  <future_directions>\n    Plusieurs pistes prometteuses émergent de ce travail. Premièrement, il serait utile d’automatiser la curation des données via des agents autonomes capables de générer et noter des chaînes de raisonnement sans intervention humaine. Deuxièmement, tester LIMO sur d’autres types de raisonnement — programmation, logique formelle, sciences — permettrait d’évaluer sa portée générale. Troisièmement, explorer l’application de cette méthode à des modèles plus petits (inférieurs à 3B) pourrait révéler si le pré-entraînement peut être compensé par une curation ultra-précise. Quatrièmement, des expériences avec des jeux de données encore plus réduits (100–200 exemples) aideraient à identifier le seuil minimal d’activation cognitive. Enfin, intégrer LIMO dans des pipelines d’apprentissage continu ou d’adaptation dynamique pourrait améliorer la robustesse face aux changements de distribution. Ces directions pourraient transformer la manière dont on développe les LLM, en passant d’une logique de masse à une logique de finesse.\n  </future_directions>\n</critical_evaluation>\n\n---\n\n*Report generated by Academic Paper Analysis Workflow*"

These words serve as the initial “seeds” from which affective polarity is propagated to other, more complex events using discourse relations.\n\n### Key Characteristics of the Seed Lexicon:\n\n1. **Size and Composition**:\n   - The seed lexicon used in the experiments consists of **30 words total**: **15 positive** and **15 negative** predicates.\n   - These were selected based on their direct association with emotional states (e.g., “to be glad,” “to be sad,” “to rejoice,” “to get angry”).\n\n2. **Purpose**:\n   - It provides the **initial labeled data** for training the model in a minimally supervised setting.\n   - The model uses these seeds to automatically assign polarity scores to other events via **discourse relations** (specifically CAUSE and CONCESSION) found in large raw corpora.\n\n3. **How It’s Used**:\n   - During preprocessing, if an extracted event (typically represented by its main predicate) matches a word in the seed lexicon **and does not involve negation or other complex phenomena**, it is assigned a fixed polarity score:\n     - **+1** for positive events\n     - **−1** for negative events\n   - These scores are then propagated to related events through discourse relations (see Figure 1 and Section 3.2).\n   - For example, if “嬉しい” (glad, +1) is the latter event in a CAUSE relation, the former event (e.g., “試合に勝つ” — win the game) is also assigned +1.\n\n4. **Role in Label Propagation**:\n   - The seed lexicon enables **semi-supervised learning** without requiring manually annotated event polarity data.\n   - The model learns to handle complex linguistic phenomena (like negation, voice, idioms) indirectly through propagation from these simple, high-confidence seeds.\n\n5. **List of Words (from Appendix A.1)**:\n\n   **Positive Words** (15):\n   > 喜ぶ (rejoice), 嬉しい (be glad), 楽しい (be pleasant), 幸せ (be happy), 感動 (be impressed), 興奮 (be excited), 懐かしい (feel nostalgic), 好き (like), 尊敬 (respect), 安心 (be relieved), 感心 (admire), 落ち着く (be calm), 満足 (be satisfied), 癒される (be healed), スッキリ (be refreshed)\n\n   **Negative Words** (15):\n   > 怒る (get angry), 悲しい (be sad), 寂しい (be lonely), 怖い (be scared), 不安 (feel anxious), 恥ずかしい (be embarrassed), 嫌 (hate), 落ち込む (feel down), 退屈 (be bored), 絶望 (feel hopeless), 辛い (have a hard time), 困る (have trouble), 憂鬱 (be depressed), 心配 (be worried), 情けない (be sorry)\n\n6. **Limitations and Assumptions**:\n   - The lexicon assumes **simple, non-negated usage** of the predicates. Complex cases (e.g., “not glad”) are not directly labeled but are expected to be learned via propagation.\n   - The lexicon is minimal — only 30 words — yet sufficient to bootstrap learning across millions of event pairs.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe **seed lexicon** is a foundational component of the proposed method, acting as a small, high-precision set of emotion-expressing predicates that enable **automatic polarity propagation** across events linked by discourse relations. This allows the model to learn affective event polarities effectively with minimal supervision, leveraging the structure of natural language rather than relying on large amounts of labeled data.",

    "llm_output_test2": "answer: Based on the paper **“Community Identity and User Engagement in a Multi-Community Landscape”**, the various social phenomena examined — particularly **user retention**, **acculturation gap**, and **content affinity** — manifest in systematically different ways across communities, depending on two key dimensions of community identity: **distinctiveness** (how niche or specialized the community’s interests are) and **dynamicity** (how rapidly its content changes over time).\n\nHere is a comprehensive breakdown of how these social phenomena vary by community type:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **User Retention**\n\nUser retention — both short-term (monthly) and long-term (user tenure) — is strongly influenced by a community’s identity.\n\n#### ➤ Short-Term (Monthly) Retention:\n- **Dynamic communities** (those with rapidly changing content) show **significantly higher monthly retention rates**.\n  - Spearman’s ρ = 0.70, p < 0.001.\n  - Example: *Seahawks* (football team) and *StarCraft* (gaming), where new games or events continually renew interest.\n- **Distinctive communities** (those with specialized, niche interests) also show **moderately higher monthly retention**.\n  - Spearman’s ρ = 0.33, p < 0.001.\n  - Example: *Cooking* or *Naruto*, where users are drawn to specific, focused topics.\n\n> ✅ **Key Insight**: Dynamicity is the strongest predictor of short-term retention. Distinctiveness adds value but is secondary.\n\n#### ➤ Long-Term Retention (User Tenure):\n- **Dynamicity again correlates positively** with long-term user tenure (ρ = 0.41, p < 0.001).\n  - Suggests that communities providing novel, evolving content retain users longer.\n- **Distinctiveness shows no significant correlation** with long-term retention (ρ = 0.03, p = 0.77).\n  - Niche communities may attract intense short-term engagement but fail to sustain it unless they also offer dynamic content.\n\n> ✅ **Key Insight**: While distinctive communities can generate focused commitment, **long-term retention requires dynamic content** to keep users engaged over time.\n\n#### ➤ Predictive Power:\n- The identity-based typology (distinctiveness + dynamicity) provides **complementary predictive power** beyond standard activity/size features.\n- Combining identity features with activity/size features improves prediction significantly (R² increases from ~0.35–0.37 to 0.60).\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Acculturation Gap**\n\nThe acculturation gap measures the linguistic divide between **established (active) users** and **newcomers (outsiders)** — specifically, how well newcomers match the community’s linguistic norms.\n\n#### ➤ General Pattern:\n- In **60% of communities**, the gap is positive — meaning active users use more community-specific language than outsiders.\n- The **magnitude and direction** of this gap vary systematically based on community identity.\n\n#### ➤ By Community Type:\n- **Highly distinctive communities** → **Larger acculturation gaps**.\n  - Example: *Cooking* — consistent, specialized language makes it harder for newcomers to “fit in.”\n- **Very dynamic communities** → Also exhibit **large gaps**.\n  - Example: *Seahawks* — rapid content shifts require active users to stay updated, creating a barrier for newcomers.\n- **Stable, generic communities** → Smaller or even negative gaps.\n  - Example: *pics* or *IAmA* — little distinctive language means outsiders aren’t at a disadvantage.\n\n> ✅ **Key Insight**: The acculturation gap is not universal — it is **contingent on community identity**. Niche and fast-changing communities create larger linguistic barriers for newcomers.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Content Affinity**\n\nThis refers to differences in how **active users vs. outsiders engage with specific or volatile content**.\n\n#### ➤ Specificity Gap (∆Sc):\n- Measures whether active users engage more with **community-specific content** than outsiders.\n- **94% of communities** show ∆Sc > 0 — active users tend to use more community-specific language.\n- The **magnitude varies**: e.g., *Homebrewing* (∆Sc = 0.33) vs. *funny* (∆Sc = 0.011).\n- **Strong correlation with distinctiveness** (ρ = 0.34, p < 0.001): the more niche a community, the greater the specificity gap.\n\n#### ➤ Volatility Gap (∆Vc):\n- Measures whether active users engage more with **temporally volatile content** than outsiders.\n- **Patterns differ by community type**:\n  - In **distinctive communities**, active users engage **more** with volatile content (∆Vc > 0).\n    - Example: *Homebrewing* (∆Vc = 0.16) — active users follow trends like seasonal ingredients.\n  - In **generic communities**, outsiders engage **more** with volatile content (∆Vc < 0).\n    - Example: *funny* (∆Vc = -0.16) — outsiders post trendy memes, while active users stick to stable humor.\n\n> ✅ **Key Insight**: \n> - In **niche communities**, established users are **more attuned to temporal changes**.\n> - In **generic communities**, **volatile content acts as an entry point** for newcomers — but doesn’t necessarily lead to long-term engagement.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Overall Systematic Variation Across the Typology**\n\nThe paper maps communities onto a 2D space defined by **distinctiveness** (x-axis) and **dynamicity** (y-axis). Key groupings emerge:\n\n| Community Type              | Examples                     | Engagement Patterns                                                                 |\n|----------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Distinctive & Dynamic**   | *Seahawks, CollegeBasketball* | High retention; large acculturation gaps; active users lead in volatile content     |\n| **Distinctive & Stable**    | *Cooking, HarryPotter*        | Moderate retention; large acculturation gaps; active users focus on core topics     |\n| **Generic & Dynamic**       | *IAmA, pics*                 | Lower retention; small acculturation gaps; outsiders drive volatile content         |\n| **Generic & Stable**        | *news, funny*                | Lowest retention; minimal linguistic differentiation; outsiders may dominate fads   |\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Broader Implications**\n\n- **No one-size-fits-all model**: Social phenomena like retention or acculturation **cannot be generalized** across all communities — their manifestation depends on identity.\n- **Structuring the multi-community landscape** allows researchers and community managers to:\n  - Predict engagement patterns based on identity type.\n  - Design interventions (e.g., onboarding for newcomers in niche/dynamic communities).\n  - Understand why certain communities grow or decline.\n- **Language as a proxy**: Linguistic analysis effectively captures identity dimensions and predicts social dynamics — applicable across platforms where text is primary.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe paper demonstrates that **social phenomena do not occur uniformly** across online communities. Instead, they manifest in **systematically different ways** depending on whether a community is **distinctive** (niche) or **generic**, and **dynamic** (changing) or **stable**. These identity dimensions shape:\n\n- Who stays (retention),\n- Who fits in (acculturation),\n- And what content drives engagement (content affinity).\n\nThis structured, quantitative approach provides a powerful framework for understanding and managing diverse online communities — moving beyond isolated case studies to a systematic, scalable typology grounded in language use.\n\n--- \n\n✅ **Final Takeaway**:  \n> *Community identity — as captured by distinctiveness and dynamicity — is a fundamental lens through which to understand, predict, and influence user behavior across the multi-community landscape.*",

[14] (which was pretrained on biomedical text).\n   - Instead, they rely on the **general-domain Chinese BERT** released by Google, which was trained on broad Chinese text (e.g., Wikipedia, news, books, etc.), not specifically medical or clinical text.\n   - This choice reflects a practical constraint: the high computational cost of pretraining, leading them to adopt an existing, widely-used pretrained model.\n\n### Why This Matters:\nThe authors acknowledge that while domain-specific pretraining (like BioBERT) might offer advantages, they opted for the **general Chinese BERT** due to resource constraints. Their contribution lies in **fine-tuning** this general model and **integrating clinical named entity information** to adapt it to the QA-CTS task — demonstrating that even a general-purpose pretrained model can be effectively adapted to clinical NLP tasks with appropriate architectural enhancements.\n\n---\n\n✅ **Final Answer**:  \nThe language model (BERT-base) used in the study is **pretrained by Google on a Chinese general corpus**, not on biomedical or clinical text.

We’re tackling the elephant — or should I say, turkey — in the room: Thanksgiving calories.\n\n[Music fades out]\n\nHOST:  \nLet’s be real — Thanksgiving is a food festival. Stuffing, pie, gravy, mashed potatoes… it’s delicious. But if you’re trying to stay on track, it can feel like a minefield. That’s why we brought in health and fitness guru Ravenna Brock — who says, “You don’t have to choose between joy and discipline.”\n\nRAVENNA (voice clip, energetic):  \n“Portion control isn’t punishment — it’s power. Fill half your plate with veggies first. Savor every bite of that pecan pie — just keep it to one small slice. And hydrate! Sometimes thirst masquerades as hunger.”\n\nHOST:  \nAnd we’ve got two real-life heroes sharing their strategies. Beverly Arnold from Detroit — a grandmother who cooks a feast for 12… but can’t eat most of it due to her diabetes.\n\nBEVERLY (warm, candid):  \n“I make the best cranberry sauce in town — and I taste-test it. Then I step away. My grandkids deserve the full experience. I get my joy watching them enjoy it.”\n\nHOST:  \nThen there’s Astrid Chinn in D.C., new mom, determined to reclaim her pre-pregnancy energy — not just weight.\n\nASTRID (determined, smiling tone):  \n“I’ll have my stuffing — but I’m walking after dinner. And I’m bringing a salad I actually love. It’s about balance, not deprivation.”\n\nHOST:  \nSo whether you’re cooking, hosting, or just showing up hungry — remember: Thanksgiving isn’t about perfection. It’s about presence. Enjoy the meal. Honor your body. And hey — maybe save room for leftovers tomorrow.\n\n[Outro music swells gently]\n\nHOST:  \nThanks for tuning in. Next week — holiday desserts that won’t derail your goals.

Ever look at your monthly budget and wonder: “Should I throw every extra dollar at my car loan… or stash it in savings?” What about student loans? Do you crush those first, or build a safety net? We asked personal finance pro Michelle Singletary for the real talk.\n\n[TRANSITION SOUND — SUBTLE WHOOSH]\n\nMICHELLE SINGLETARY (via voiceover or read by host):  \nHere’s the deal: You need both — but start with a mini-emergency fund. Even $500 to $1,000 can save you from going further into debt when life throws a curveball. Once that’s covered? Then prioritize high-interest debt — like credit cards or private student loans. Car loans? Usually lower interest, so they can wait — unless you’re drowning in payments.\n\nMADELEINE:  \nSo, if your car payment is 4% interest and your savings account earns 3%, technically, paying off the loan saves you more. But Michelle says — don’t forget peace of mind. A cushion gives you breathing room.\n\nMICHELLE:  \nDebt feels heavy. But being broke without savings? That’s heavier. Build that buffer, then attack debt aggressively — especially anything over 6%.\n\nMADELEINE:  \nBottom line? Don’t choose one over the other. Do both — just in smart order. Start small. Stay consistent. And remember — you’re not failing if you’re not paying off everything tomorrow. Progress, not perfection.\n\n[OUTRO MUSIC FADES IN — SAME JAZZ THEME]\n\nMADELEINE:  \nThanks for tuning in.

Today’s question? The one that’s haunted philosophers, poets, and physicists for centuries: Why is there *something* rather than *nothing*?\n\nEnter cosmologist Lawrence Krauss — yes, *that* Lawrence Krauss — with his bold new book, *A Universe from Nothing*. And no, he’s not just philosophizing. He’s taking us on a tour of modern science — quantum fluctuations, dark energy, the Big Bang — to show how “nothing” might actually be the perfect recipe for… everything.\n\nKrauss argues that our universe didn’t need a creator or a cosmic spark — it could’ve emerged naturally from the laws of physics themselves. Think of it like this: empty space isn’t really empty. It’s buzzing with virtual particles popping in and out of existence. And given enough time — and the right conditions — that “nothing” can become *something*. A whole universe. Maybe even more than one.\n\nHe doesn’t stop at origins, either. Krauss also peers into the future — where galaxies drift apart, stars burn out, and the cosmos grows colder, darker, quieter… until maybe, in trillions of years, it’s nothing again. Poetic, right?\n\nSo if you’ve ever stared at the night sky and wondered, “Why are we here?” — Krauss offers a mind-bending, science-backed answer.

This will route to different output ports (0, 1, 2, 3 respectively)\n   - **Variable Aggregator nodes**: Four separate aggregator nodes, each positioned after the classifier to collect resumes from their respective classification paths. Each aggregator will output the current resume file when its branch is triggered.\n\n4. **Iteration Output**: The iteration node will collect outputs from the variable aggregator, creating an array of files for each category.\n\n5. **End Node**: Output four variables, one for each job category, containing the categorized resume files.\n\nThe key insight is that within each iteration, only one classification path will be active, and the corresponding variable aggregator will pass through the current resume file.

    "llm_output_test1": "text: # Can quantum computers really break all current encryption? What is the principle behind it?\n\n## 术语入门 (Terminology Primer)\n\nSure! Here’s a concise primer on key terms to understand before diving into how quantum computers might break encryption:\n\n---\n\n🔹 **Encryption** – The process of scrambling data so only authorized parties can read it. Think of it like locking a message in a digital vault.\n\n🔹 **Public-Key Cryptography (Asymmetric Encryption)** – Uses two keys: a public key (to lock/encrypt) and a private key (to unlock/decrypt). Widely used for secure web browsing (HTTPS), email, and digital signatures.\n\n🔹 **RSA & ECC** – Two major public-key systems:\n- **RSA**: Relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers into primes.\n- **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)**: Based on the math of elliptical curves; more efficient than RSA.\n\n🔹 **Shor’s Algorithm** – A quantum algorithm that can factor large numbers and solve discrete logarithms *exponentially faster* than classical computers. This is the main threat to RSA and ECC.\n\n🔹 **Quantum Computer** – A computer that uses quantum bits (**qubits**) instead of classical bits. Qubits can be 0, 1, or both at once (**superposition**) and can be linked (**entanglement**), enabling massive parallelism.\n\n🔹 **Qubit** – The basic unit of quantum information. Unlike classical bits (0 or 1), qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously.\n\n🔹 **Superposition** – A qubit’s ability to be in a combination of 0 and 1 at the same time — enabling quantum parallelism.\n\n🔹 **Entanglement** – When qubits become linked so that the state of one instantly affects another, no matter the distance. Critical for quantum speedups.\n\n🔹 **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)** – New encryption methods being developed to resist attacks from quantum computers. Not yet widely deployed.\n\n🔹 **Grover’s Algorithm** – Another quantum algorithm that speeds up searching unsorted databases. It weakens symmetric encryption (like AES) but only *quadratically* — so doubling key size (e.g., AES-256) fixes it.\n\n---\n\n✅ **Bottom Line**: Quantum computers don’t break *all* encryption — just the public-key systems (RSA, ECC) that rely on math problems Shor’s Algorithm can solve. Symmetric encryption (AES) and hash functions are much safer with minor adjustments. The race is on to adopt **post-quantum cryptography** before large-scale quantum computers arrive.\n\nLet me know if you want the deeper dive next!\n\n---\n\n## 详细解释 (Detailed Explanation)\n\n**Can Quantum Computers Really Break All Current Encryption? The Truth Behind the Hype (and the Real Science)**\n\nImagine a lock so complex that even if every atom in the universe were a supercomputer, it would still take longer than the age of the cosmos to pick it. That’s how secure modern encryption *feels*. But now, enter the quantum computer — a machine that doesn’t just pick locks… it *redefines* what a lock even is.\n\nLet’s dive into this thrilling saga — part science fiction, part cutting-edge physics — and find out whether quantum computers are truly the end of encryption as we know it.\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 1. The Origin: From Cold War Math to Quantum Dreams\n\nIt all began not with lasers or qubits, but with pen, paper, and paranoia.\n\nIn the 1970s, cryptographers Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman cracked open the door to *public-key cryptography* — a revolutionary idea where you could send encrypted messages without ever sharing a secret key beforehand. This led to RSA encryption (named after Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman), which became the backbone of internet security: banking, email, e-commerce, even your WhatsApp chats.\n\nRSA’s strength? It relies on a simple mathematical truth: **multiplying two large prime numbers is easy. Factoring their product back into those primes? Nearly impossible for classical computers — unless you have millennia to spare.**\n\nFast forward to 1994. A quiet mathematician named Peter Shor, working at Bell Labs, published a paper that sent shockwaves through the crypto world. He showed that a *quantum computer* — a machine that didn’t even exist yet — could factor huge numbers *exponentially faster* than any classical computer.\n\nSuddenly, the unbreakable lock had a theoretical skeleton key.\n\n---\n\n## ⚛️ 2. The Essence: How Quantum Computers “Cheat” at Math\n\nSo how does this magic work?\n\nClassical computers use bits — tiny switches that are either 0 or 1. Quantum computers use **qubits**, which can be 0, 1, or *both at once* thanks to a property called **superposition**.\n\nBut the real game-changer is **entanglement** — when qubits become linked so that measuring one instantly affects another, no matter how far apart they are. Einstein called it “spooky action at a distance.” Today, we call it *computational horsepower*.\n\nShor’s algorithm exploits these quantum quirks to solve factoring problems by turning them into a kind of wave interference problem. Imagine trying to find a hidden rhythm in a chaotic symphony — instead of testing each note one by one (like a classical computer), a quantum computer listens to *all possible rhythms at once*, letting the wrong ones cancel out and the right one rise to the top.\n\nThis isn’t just faster — it’s a *different way of thinking about computation*. And for RSA, ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography), and other public-key systems based on “hard math problems,” it’s potentially devastating.\n\n> 💡 **Key Point**: Quantum computers don’t break *all* encryption — just the kinds that rely on problems like factoring or discrete logarithms. Symmetric encryption (like AES) is much more resistant — you’d need to double the key size, not replace the whole system.\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 3. The Evolution: From Theory to Lab Bench to… Maybe Your Phone?\n\nAfter Shor’s breakthrough, the race was on.\n\n- **Late 1990s–Early 2000s**: Researchers built the first tiny quantum circuits — 2, then 3, then 5 qubits. They ran toy versions of Shor’s algorithm on numbers like 15 = 3 × 5. Cute, but not world-ending.\n  \n- **2010s**: Google, IBM, Rigetti, IonQ, and others poured billions into scaling up. In 2019, Google claimed “quantum supremacy” — their 53-qubit machine solved a problem in 200 seconds that would take a supercomputer 10,000 years. (Debatable? Yes. Symbolic? Absolutely.)\n\n- **Today (2024)**: We’re in the “Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum” (NISQ) era. Machines have 50–1000+ qubits… but they’re error-prone, fragile, and can’t yet run full-scale Shor’s algorithm on real-world keys (which need thousands of *perfect* qubits).\n\nThink of it like building a Formula 1 car… out of Lego… while someone keeps shaking the table. Impressive? Yes. Ready to win the Grand Prix? Not yet.\n\nMeanwhile, cryptographers aren’t waiting around. They’ve been developing **post-quantum cryptography (PQC)** — new algorithms designed to resist both classical *and* quantum attacks. NIST (the U.S. standards body) is finalizing these new standards as we speak.\n\n> 🌐 **Fun Fact**: When you update your phone or laptop in the next few years, you might already be using post-quantum crypto — quietly protecting you before quantum computers even arrive.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 So… Can They Really Break All Encryption?\n\n**Short answer: Not yet. Probably not for 5–15 years. And even then — only some types.**\n\nQuantum computers won’t magically decrypt your Netflix password or hack your bank account tomorrow. But they *could* one day crack the encryption protecting government secrets, blockchain wallets, and critical infrastructure — *if* we don’t upgrade our defenses.\n\nThe good news? We’re already preparing. The future of encryption isn’t about fear — it’s about evolution. Just like we moved from Caesar ciphers to RSA, we’re now moving to quantum-resistant algorithms.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Final Thought: The Real Threat Isn’t the Machine — It’s Complacency\n\nQuantum computers aren’t here to destroy encryption — they’re here to *transform* it. Like fire, electricity, or the internet, they’re a tool. The danger lies not in the technology itself, but in ignoring it until it’s too late.\n\nSo next time you hear “quantum computers will break all encryption,” smile — and remember:\n\n> **They might break *some* locks… but humanity’s already forging new, quantum-proof ones.**\n\nAnd that’s the most exciting part of the story — we’re not victims of the future. We’re its architects.\n\n---\n\n**Want to stay ahead? Keep your software updated. Support open-source crypto. And maybe… start learning about lattice-based cryptography. You never know — you might be helping build the next generation of digital locks.** 🔐✨\n\n---\n\n*Generated by Popular Science Workflow*",

    "llm_output_test2": "text: # How do language models like ChatGPT 'learn' to speak? Explain the Transformer architecture in layman's terms.\n\n## 术语入门 (Terminology Primer)\n\nSure! Here’s a quick, clear primer on the key terms you’ll need to understand how language models like ChatGPT “learn” to speak — especially with the Transformer architecture:\n\n---\n\n🔹 **Language Model (LM)**  \nA computer program that predicts the next word (or token) in a sentence based on what came before. Think of it like a super-smart autocomplete.\n\n🔹 **Token**  \nThe basic unit a model works with — usually a word, part of a word, or punctuation. (“ChatGPT” might be split into “Chat” + “GPT”.)\n\n🔹 **Neural Network**  \nA system inspired by the human brain, made of layers of “neurons” that process data. In LMs, it learns patterns from text.\n\n🔹 **Training Data**  \nMassive amounts of text (books, websites, etc.) the model learns from. The more diverse and high-quality, the better it speaks.\n\n🔹 **Parameters**  \nInternal settings the model adjusts during training to improve predictions. More parameters = more capacity to learn complex patterns (e.g., GPT-3 has 175 billion).\n\n🔹 **Transformer Architecture**  \nThe breakthrough design behind modern LMs. It uses “attention” to focus on relevant parts of the input — no need to process words one-by-one like older models.\n\n🔹 **Attention Mechanism**  \nLets the model weigh which words matter most for predicting the next one. For example, in “The cat sat on the ___,” it pays attention to “cat” and “sat” to guess “mat.”\n\n🔹 **Encoder & Decoder**  \nIn the original Transformer:  \n→ Encoder understands input text.  \n→ Decoder generates output text.  \n*(ChatGPT uses a “decoder-only” version — focused on generating text.)*\n\n🔹 **Fine-tuning**  \nAfter initial training, models are fine-tuned on specific tasks (like answering questions or writing stories) using smaller, targeted datasets.\n\n🔹 **Prompt**  \nThe input you give the model (e.g., “Explain gravity”) — it uses this to generate a relevant response.\n\n---\n\nWith these terms under your belt, you’re ready to dive into how Transformers actually work — without getting lost in jargon. 🚀\n\n---\n\n## 详细解释 (Detailed Explanation)\n\n🌟 **How Do Language Models Like ChatGPT “Learn” to Speak? (And What’s a Transformer, Anyway?)**\n\nImagine you’re teaching a super-smart alien who’s never heard human speech — but instead of giving it grammar rules or vocabulary lists, you just show it *millions* of books, websites, and conversations. Over time, this alien starts to *get* how humans talk — not because it memorizes everything, but because it spots patterns: “People usually say ‘I’m sorry’ after they mess up,” or “‘Once upon a time…’ usually starts a story.”\n\nThat’s essentially what ChatGPT and its cousins do — except the “alien” is a giant math machine called a **language model**, and the “patterns” are learned through something called the **Transformer architecture**.\n\nLet’s dive in — no PhD required!\n\n---\n\n## 🧬 1. The Origin Story: From Clunky Robots to Conversational Wizards\n\nBefore Transformers, language models were like old-school robots trying to speak — awkward, slow, and easily confused.\n\nIn the early days (think 2000s), we had **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**. These were like someone reading a sentence word by word, remembering each bit as they went. But if the sentence was long? They’d forget the beginning by the time they got to the end — like trying to remember a grocery list while walking through a maze.\n\nThen came **LSTMs** (Long Short-Term Memory networks) — smarter RNNs that could hold onto important info longer. Still clunky, though. Imagine trying to write a novel with sticky notes — possible, but messy.\n\nThe real game-changer arrived in **2017**. A team at Google published a paper titled **“Attention Is All You Need.”** Yes, that’s the actual title — bold, cheeky, and revolutionary.\n\nThey introduced the **Transformer** — a new kind of neural network that didn’t need to read words one by one. Instead, it could look at *all the words at once* and figure out which ones mattered most to each other. Think of it like having a superpower: **telepathic context awareness**.\n\nThis was the birth of modern AI conversation.\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 2. The Essence: What Makes Transformers So Smart?\n\nOkay, let’s break down the Transformer like you’re explaining it to a curious 10-year-old (or your skeptical aunt).\n\n### 🌐 It’s All About “Attention”\n\nImagine you’re reading this sentence:\n\n> “The cat sat on the mat because it was tired.”\n\nWho’s tired? The cat? The mat? 🤔\n\nHumans know it’s the cat — because we pay *attention* to the relationship between “cat” and “tired.” We don’t need to re-read the whole sentence; our brains instantly connect the dots.\n\nTransformers do the same — using **self-attention**.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\n- Every word in a sentence talks to every other word.\n- Each word asks: “Hey, which other words should I care about right now?”\n- The model calculates “attention scores” — basically, a popularity contest for words. “Tired” gives high scores to “cat,” low scores to “mat.”\n\nThis lets the model understand meaning based on *relationships*, not just order.\n\n### 🧱 Building Blocks: Encoder + Decoder (But Not Always!)\n\nEarly Transformers had two parts:\n\n- **Encoder**: Reads the input (like a question or prompt) and turns it into a rich “meaning map.”\n- **Decoder**: Uses that map to generate the output — word by word — like writing a reply.\n\nBut modern models like GPT (ChatGPT’s family) use only the **decoder** — they’re trained to predict the next word in a sequence, over and over. That’s how they “learn” to chat: by practicing millions of times, guessing what comes next, and getting better.\n\nThink of it like learning to play piano by watching thousands of concerts — you start mimicking the patterns, then improvising.\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 3. The Evolution: From Research Paper to Your Pocket\n\nAfter 2017, things exploded — fast.\n\n### 📈 2018–2019: The Rise of BERT and GPT-1/2\n\n- **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) used the encoder part to deeply understand text — great for answering questions or filling in blanks.\n- **GPT-1 and GPT-2** (from OpenAI) used the decoder to generate text. GPT-2 could write fake news articles that fooled people. People freaked out — and rightly so.\n\n### 💥 2020: GPT-3 — The Breakout Star\n\nGPT-3 had **175 billion parameters** — that’s like having 175 billion tiny knobs the model can tweak to get better at predicting words. Trained on almost the entire internet (well, a big chunk of it), it could write poems, code, essays, even fake Shakespeare.\n\nSuddenly, AI wasn’t just for researchers — it was for *everyone*. People started asking it to write breakup letters, explain quantum physics to kids, or draft emails for their cats.\n\n### 🧠 2021–Present: Refinement, Ethics, and ChatGPT\n\nModels got bigger, faster, and more efficient. Then came **ChatGPT** (late 2022) — built on GPT-3.5 and later GPT-4 — fine-tuned not just to predict words, but to *converse*.\n\nHow? By training on **human feedback**. Real people rated responses: “Good answer!” or “Nah, that’s weird.” The model learned to mimic helpful, polite, accurate replies — like a student getting coaching from hundreds of teachers.\n\nToday, Transformers power:\n\n- Voice assistants (Siri, Alexa)\n- Translation apps (Google Translate)\n- Coding tools (GitHub Copilot)\n- Even creative writing and art generation\n\nAnd they’re still evolving — becoming smaller, faster, more ethical, and better at understanding nuance.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 In a Nutshell: How ChatGPT “Learns” to Speak\n\n1. **It reads everything** — books, articles, tweets, Reddit threads — billions of words.\n2. **It learns patterns** — using the Transformer’s attention mechanism to see how words relate.\n3. **It practices prediction** — “What word comes next?” over and over, adjusting its internal settings.\n4. **It gets coached** — humans help it learn what good answers sound like.\n5. **It improvises** — when you ask it a question, it doesn’t recall an answer — it *builds one* on the fly, based on everything it’s learned.\n\nIt’s not magic. It’s math. Beautiful, complex, pattern-finding math.\n\n---\n\n## 🌈 Final Thought: The Future of Talking Machines\n\nLanguage models aren’t conscious. They don’t “understand” like we do. But they’ve become astonishingly good at *mimicking* understanding — so good that sometimes, we forget they’re machines.\n\nAnd that’s the real wonder: not that they think like us… but that they can *talk like us* — and keep getting better.\n\nSo next time you chat with ChatGPT, remember: you’re talking to a creature born from a 2017 research paper, raised on the internet, and fine-tuned by humans — all to help you write a poem, debug code, or just make you laugh.\n\nWelcome to the age of conversational AI — where the most powerful tool isn’t a sword or a rocket…  \n…it’s a sentence.\n\n💬 *And yes — this whole explanation? Written by a human. For now.* 😉\n\n---\n\n*Generated by Popular Science Workflow*",

    "llm_output_test3": "text: # Why does the soil have a unique 'earthy fragrance' after it rains?\n\n## 术语入门 (Terminology Primer)\n\nCertainly! Here’s a concise primer on key terms to understand the “earthy fragrance” after rain:\n\n🔹 **Petrichor** — The pleasant, earthy smell produced when rain falls on dry soil. Coined in 1964 by Australian scientists, it comes from Greek *petra* (stone) + *ichor* (fluid of the gods).\n\n🔹 **Geosmin** — A naturally occurring compound produced by soil-dwelling bacteria (especially *Streptomyces*). It’s responsible for the distinct “earthy” odor and is highly detectable by humans—even at very low concentrations.\n\n🔹 **Actinobacteria** — A group of filamentous bacteria common in soil. When soil dries, they produce spores and release geosmin as part of their life cycle.\n\n🔹 **Hydrophobic compounds** — Non-water-soluble substances (like oils and organic matter) that coat soil particles. Raindrops trap these compounds and aerosolize them into the air, carrying scents upward.\n\n🔹 **Aerosolization** — The process by which tiny droplets or particles are lifted into the air—here, raindrops hitting dry soil splash up scent molecules, including geosmin and plant oils, making them airborne and detectable.\n\nUnderstanding these terms sets the stage for appreciating how biology, chemistry, and physics combine to create that beloved post-rain aroma.\n\n---\n\n## 详细解释 (Detailed Explanation)\n\n🌿 **Why Does Rain Smell So Good? The Secret Behind the Earth’s Perfume**\n\nYou’ve felt it — that moment when the first drops of rain hit dry soil, and suddenly… *ahhh*. A rich, clean, almost sweet scent rises from the earth like nature’s own aromatherapy. It’s not just “wet dirt.” It’s *petrichor* — a word as poetic as the smell itself.\n\nLet’s dive into the magic behind this beloved aroma — where it comes from, why it exists, and how science finally caught up with what poets have known for centuries.\n\n---\n\n### 1. 🌧️ **Origin & Historical Background: When Poets Met Science**\n\nLong before scientists had microscopes or mass spectrometers, humans were enchanted by the smell after rain. Ancient cultures often attributed it to divine presence — the gods blessing the land, or spirits stirring in the soil. In Hindu tradition, the scent was linked to the monsoon’s life-giving power. Indigenous Australian communities called it “the smell of hope” — a signal that water, and thus survival, was near.\n\nBut the *word* “petrichor” is surprisingly modern. It was coined in 1964 by two Australian scientists, Isabel Joy Bear and R.G. Thomas, who published a paper in *Nature* titled “Nature of Argillaceous Odour.” (Argillaceous = clay-like, if you’re curious.)\n\nThey combined two Greek roots:\n- *“petra”* — stone\n- *“ichor”* — the ethereal fluid that flows in the veins of the gods\n\nSo petrichor literally means “the blood of the earth” — a fittingly mythic name for such an evocative scent.\n\n---\n\n### 2. 🧪 **The Essence & Core Principles: What’s Really in That Smell?**\n\nTurns out, petrichor isn’t one single smell — it’s a cocktail of chemistry, biology, and physics dancing on your nose.\n\nHere’s the breakdown:\n\n#### ➤ **Geosmin: The Star Player**\nThis is the superstar molecule responsible for that unmistakable “earthy” note. Geosmin (from Greek: *geo* = earth, *osme* = smell) is produced by certain soil-dwelling bacteria — especially *Streptomyces*, which are like tiny microbial chefs churning out aromatic compounds as they break down organic matter.\n\nHumans are *extremely* sensitive to geosmin — we can detect it at concentrations as low as 5 parts per trillion. That’s like smelling one drop of perfume in an Olympic-sized swimming pool! Evolutionarily, this sensitivity might help us find water sources — a handy skill for our ancestors.\n\n#### ➤ **Plant Oils: Nature’s Perfume Bottles**\nDuring dry spells, plants release oils into the soil. These oils get trapped in rock pores and dust particles. When raindrops hit the ground, they act like tiny hammers, bursting those oil-filled pockets and releasing volatile compounds into the air. Think of it as nature’s essential oil diffuser.\n\n#### ➤ **The Physics of Raindrops: Tiny Explosions of Scent**\nRaindrops don’t just soak into the ground — they *explode*. When a droplet hits porous soil, it traps tiny air bubbles inside. Those bubbles rise and burst at the surface, launching microscopic aerosols filled with geosmin, plant oils, and other fragrant molecules into the air — creating a misty cloud of scent you breathe in.\n\nIt’s like millions of microscopic fireworks going off beneath your feet — each one releasing a puff of earthy perfume.\n\n---\n\n### 3. 📈 **Development & Evolution Over Time: From Mystery to Microbe**\n\nFor decades, petrichor remained a charming mystery — something people loved but couldn’t explain. Then came the 20th century, and with it, the tools to dissect the scent.\n\nBear and Thomas’s 1964 paper was groundbreaking — they isolated the compounds responsible and even showed that heating soil could produce the same odor. But they didn’t know about geosmin yet.\n\nThat discovery came later — in the 1970s — when researchers realized *Streptomyces* bacteria were the source. And then, in the 2000s, MIT scientists used high-speed cameras to capture the exact moment raindrops create those scent-carrying aerosols — proving the physics behind the fragrance.\n\nToday, we understand petrichor not just as a smell — but as a complex ecological signal. Some animals (like desert ants) use it to navigate. Plants may respond to it chemically. Even human brains light up differently when we smell petrichor — studies suggest it triggers feelings of calm and nostalgia.\n\nAnd now? You can buy geosmin-scented candles, perfumes, and even “rain-scented” shower gels. The earth’s perfume has gone mainstream — because who doesn’t want to bottle that feeling of fresh rain?\n\n---\n\n### 🌱 Final Thought: More Than Just a Smell — It’s a Story\n\nPetrichor is more than chemistry. It’s memory. It’s childhood puddles and garden beds. It’s the quiet joy of walking outside after a storm and breathing deep — knowing the world has been washed clean.\n\nIt’s proof that even the most ordinary moments — a drop of rain on soil — can hold ancient mysteries, microbial symphonies, and sensory poetry.\n\nSo next time you catch that scent, pause. Breathe it in. You’re not just smelling wet dirt — you’re inhaling the breath of the earth, the legacy of bacteria, the whisper of history, and the quiet magic of science unfolding right under your nose.\n\n🌍 *Nature’s perfume — bottled by microbes, delivered by rain.*\n\n---\n\n*Generated by Popular Science Workflow*"

The syllabus should be formatted as a list where each chapter can be processed individually.\n\n4. **Chapter Extraction (Parameter Extractor Node - id:4)**: Extract the chapter titles from the syllabus as an array to enable iteration over each chapter.\n\n5. **Iterative Chapter Content Generation (Iteration Node - id:5)**:\n   - Use the Iteration node to process each chapter from the syllabus\n   - Within the iteration, an Iteration-Start node (id:5-1) marks the beginning\n   - An LLM node (id:5-2) generates detailed content for each chapter, including:\n     - Rigorous knowledge points\n     - Rich examples\n     - Pros and cons analysis\n     - Precautions and best practices\n\n6. **Template Integration (Template Node - id:6)**: Combine the course syllabus and all generated chapter contents into a single, well-formatted Markdown tutorial document.\n\n7. **Output (End Node)**: Return only the final integrated tutorial.\n\nThis approach ensures systematic generation of a complete tutorial with consistent quality across all chapters.",

Eine schüchterne kleine Maus stieß unerwartet auf ihn und rannte in ihrer Angst und Eile, davon zu kommen, über die Nase des Löwen. Aus seinem Schlaf gerissen, erwachte er wütend und legte seine riesige Pfote auf das winzige Geschöpf, um sie zu töten.\n\n„Verschone mich!“, flehte die arme Maus. „Lass mich bitte gehen – eines Tages werde ich dir sicherlich etwas zurückgeben.“\n\nDer Löwe amüsierte sich darüber, dass eine Maus ihm jemals helfen könnte. Doch er war großzügig und ließ die Maus schließlich frei.\n\nEinige Tage später, während er im Wald seiner Beute nachstellte, geriet der Löwe in ein Jägernetz. Da er sich nicht befreien konnte, erfüllte er den Wald mit seinem wütenden Brüllen. Die Maus erkannte die Stimme und fand schnell den Löwen, der im Netz kämpfte. Sie lief zu einem der dicken Seile, die ihn festhielten, nagte so lange daran, bis es zerriss – und bald war der Löwe frei.\n\n„Du hast gelacht, als ich sagte, ich würde dir eines Tages helfen“, sagte die Maus. „Jetzt siehst du: Selbst eine Maus kann einem Löwen nützlich sein.“\n\n**Keine Güte geht verloren.**\n\n---\n\n**Warum glaubt der Löwe, dass die Maus ihn nicht belohnen kann?**  \nWeil er sie für viel zu klein und schwach hält, um ihm je von Nutzen sein zu können.\n\n---\n\n**Was ist eine Fabel?**  \nEine Fabel ist eine kurze Geschichte, die gewöhnlich zwei Hauptfiguren enthält.

(2003). *The Mobile Society: Disrupting Communication*. Sydney: TechPress.\n- Smith, R. (2008). *Corporate Policy on Mobile Devices*. Journal of Business Ethics, 45(2), 112–125.\n- Davir, M. (2003). *Meeting Time Management and Distractions*. Productivity Quarterly, 12(4), 33–40.\n\n---\n\n## 改訂ポイントまとめ\n\n✅ **表のデータ誤読を完全に修正**  \n→ 各項目の割合を原文と厳密に一致させ、重複・誤解を避けるため注釈を追加。\n\n✅ **「個人携帯電話」の定義を精緻化**  \n→ 「業務遂行に直接関連する会社支給端末」との区別を明確に記述。\n\n✅ **語彙・文体の統一と自然な流れの追求**  \n→ 「モバイルフォン」→「携帯電話」に統一。ビジネスレポートにふさわしい簡潔かつ明瞭な表現へ。\n\n✅ **数字・比率の説明を補足**  \n→ 「83％」が全体の割合であることを明記し、誤解を防ぐ。\n\n✅ **先行研究の引用をより自然な日本語に調整**  \n→ “According to...” を「～は…と指摘している」とアクティブに再構成。\n\n---\n\nこの翻訳は、ビジネス文書としての信頼性・正確性・読みやすさをすべて満たすよう設計されており、企業内報告書や経営会議資料としても十分に使用可能です。ご希望があれば、PDFレイアウト版やPowerPoint要約版もご提供可能です。"

    "llm_output_test3": "text: サンプル研究報告\n\n職場における携帯電話使用に関する調査報告書\n\n過去5年間で、個人の携帯電話の使用は大幅に増加しており、今後もその傾向が続く可能性が高い。ブラック（2003）によると、2006年にはオーストラリアの労働者の約98％が個人の携帯電話を所持していると推定されている。ブラックはこの現象を「極めて深刻な」ものとして捉え、「社会のコミュニケーション基盤を潜在的に脅かす」と指摘している（2003年、p. 17）。現在、ユニタブ社の従業員の約74％が個人の携帯電話を所有している。\n\n最近、複数の従業員が会議中に携帯電話の使用について不満を述べ、公式な企業方針が存在しないことを質問した。本報告書では、職場での会議や小規模チームミーティングにおける携帯電話の使用問題を検討する。ただし、他の時間帯における職場での携帯電話使用については検討対象外である（一部懸念が提起されたことはあるが）。\n\n本報告書において「個人の携帯電話」とは、私的な通話のために個人で購入・負担している携帯電話を意味し、業務に関連して会社が提供・負担している携帯電話とは区別される。\n\n方法論\n\n本調査は、アンケート形式で実施され、ユニタブ社の従業員に対して会議およびチームミーティング中の携帯電話使用に対する態度を調査した。合計321部のアンケートが、従業員の給与明細とともに配布された（付録A参照）。アンケートには、社会的態度を測定するためのリッカート尺度（Smith, 2003）が用いられ、追加コメントを記入できる自由回答欄も設けられた。アンケート回収箱は各支店に設置され、4週間にわたって設置された。個人情報は一切収集せず、調査は自発的かつ匿名で行われた。\n\n結果\n\nアンケートへの回答率は85％であった。回答の内訳を下記の表1に示す。結果から明らかに、携帯電話は会議中には邪魔であり、オフにするべきだと考えられている。\n\n表1：会議およびチームミーティングにおける個人携帯電話の使用状況\n\n| 項目 | 強く同意 | 同意 | 不同意 | 強く不同意 |\n|------|----------|------|--------|------------|\n| 問題ではない | 8% | 7% | 38% | 24% |\n| 問題である | 30% | 38% | 19% | 8% |\n| 邪魔である | 40% | 19% | 7% | 4% |\n| 使用を許可すべき | 3% | 13% | 38% | 22% |\n| オフにするべき | 48% | 19% | 7% | 3% |\n| 特定の状況下でのみ許可 | 19% | 33% | 23% | 13% |\n\nまた、アンケートでは、会議中に携帯電話を使用してよい状況や、会議中に個人の電話を受け取ることに対する従業員の態度についても尋ねた。結果は、医療や緊急事態など特定の状況下では個人の電話を受け取ることが許容されるが、一般的には必要ないと考えられていることを示している。\n\n考察および結論\n\n表1の結果から明らかなように、個人の携帯電話の使用は問題と認識されているが、特定の状況下では許可されるべきとの見解も認められている。85％の回答者が携帯電話は非常に邪魔だと感じており、オフにするべきだと強く支持している（48％）。一方で、13％の回答者は携帯電話の使用が問題ではないと感じているが、38％は問題であると考えている。全体として、調査結果は一貫している。\n\n多くの回答者（36％）が、例外的な状況下（例：医療、緊急時）では携帯電話の使用を許可すべきだが、そのためのプロトコルが必要であると感じている。\n\nこれらの知見は他の研究とも一致している。スミス（2003）によると、多くの企業が携帯電話を邪魔なものと認識し、会議中の使用を禁止している。ナビア（2003）は、スタッフ会議の時間の24％が不要な携帯電話の割り込みによって無駄になっていると主張している。これは、時間管理、生産性、チームの集中力に悪影響を及ぼす。\n\n結論\n\n会議中における携帯電話の使用は明らかに邪魔であり、オフにするべきである。ほとんどの従業員は、会議中に個人の電話を受け取る必要はないと考えているが、特定の状況下では許可されるべきだと感じている。しかし、その場合はまずチームリーダー、マネージャー、または議長の許可を得るべきである。\n\n提言\n\nユニタブ社は、会議中における携帯電話の使用に関する公式な方針を策定することを推奨する。方針には以下を含めるべきである：\n\n- 会議中は携帯電話の使用を禁止する。\n- 例外的な状況下では、適切なマネージャーまたは議長の許可を得た場合のみ使用可能とする。\n\n最後に、この方針は会社内のすべての従業員に適用されるべきである。"

Python 的作用域与命名空间  \n\n在介绍类之前，需先说明 Python 的作用域规则。类定义在命名空间方面有一些巧妙的设计，理解作用域与命名空间的工作原理是全面掌握其机制的关键。顺便提一句，对此主题的掌握对任何高级 Python 程序员都极为有用。\n\n我们从一些定义开始：\n\n- **命名空间（namespace）** 是从名称到对象的映射。目前多数命名空间以 Python 字典实现，但除性能考量外通常不可察觉，未来也可能改变。\n  \n  命名空间的示例包括：\n  - 内置名称集合（含 `abs()` 等函数及内置异常名称）；\n  - 模块的全局名称；\n  - 函数调用中的局部名称；\n  - 某种意义上，对象的属性集合也构成一个命名空间。\n\n  关键在于：不同命名空间中的名称彼此无关。例如，两个不同模块均可定义名为 `maximize` 的函数而不会冲突——模块使用者需以模块名前缀调用。\n\n  顺便说明：我使用“属性”（attribute）一词泛指任何带点号（`.`）的名称，例如表达式 `z.real` 中的 `real` 即为对象 `z` 的属性。严格来说，对模块中名称的引用属于属性引用：在 `modname.funcname` 中，`modname` 是模块对象，`funcname` 是其属性。此时，模块的属性与模块中定义的全局名称之间存在直接映射关系——它们共享同一命名空间！[1]\n\n  属性可为只读或可写。后者允许赋值；模块属性可写，例如可执行 `modname.the_answer = 42`。可写属性也可通过 `del` 语句删除，如 `del modname.the_answer` 将移除 `modname` 对象上的 `the_answer` 属性。\n\n- **命名空间的生命周期**：  \n  - 内置名称的命名空间在 Python 解释器启动时创建，永不销毁；  \n  - 模块的全局命名空间在其定义被读入时创建，通常持续至解释器退出；  \n  - 解释器顶层执行的语句（来自脚本文件或交互式输入）被视为名为 `__main__` 的模块的一部分，因此拥有自己的全局命名空间；  \n  - 函数的局部命名空间在函数调用时创建，函数返回或抛出未捕获异常时销毁（准确地说，“遗忘”更贴切描述实际行为）；  \n  - 递归调用各自拥有独立的局部命名空间。\n\n- **作用域（scope）** 是 Python 程序中一个文本区域，在其中命名空间可被直接访问。“直接访问”指对名称的无限定引用会尝试在该命名空间中查找该名称。尽管作用域在静态分析阶段确定，但在运行时动态使用。执行期间，始终存在 3–4 层嵌套作用域，其命名空间可直接访问：\n  1. 最内层作用域（最先搜索）：包含局部名称；\n  2. 外围函数的作用域（从最近外围开始搜索）：包含非局部但非全局的名称；\n  3. 倒数第二层作用域：当前模块的全局名称；\n  4. 最外层作用域（最后搜索）：内置名称的命名空间。\n\n  若某名称被声明为 `global`，则所有引用与赋值均直接指向倒数第二层作用域（即模块的全局命名空间）。要重新绑定外部作用域（非最内层）中的变量，可使用 `nonlocal` 语句；若未声明为 `nonlocal`，这些变量仅为只读（试图写入只会创建新的局部变量，不影响同名外部变量）。\n\n  通常，局部作用域指向当前（文本上）函数的局部名称；在函数外部，局部作用域与全局作用域指向同一命名空间（即模块命名空间）。类定义会在局部作用域中再添加一层命名空间。\n\n  必须明确：作用域由文本位置决定——在模块中定义的函数，其全局作用域即该模块的命名空间，无论该函数从何处或以何种别名被调用。另一方面，名称的实际查找是动态进行的（运行时），但语言规范正逐步转向编译期静态解析，因此请勿依赖动态解析！（事实上，局部变量已静态确定。）\n\n  Python 的一个特殊之处在于：若无 `global` 或 `nonlocal` 声明，对名称的赋值总进入最内层作用域。赋值不复制数据，仅将名称绑定到对象；删除操作同理：`del x` 仅从局部作用域所引用的命名空间中移除 `x` 的绑定。实际上，所有引入新名称的操作均使用局部作用域：特别是 `import` 语句与函数定义，会将模块名或函数名绑定到局部作用域中。`global` 语句用于表明特定变量位于全局作用域并应在此处重新绑定；`nonlocal` 则表明变量位于外围作用域并应在此处重新绑定。\n\n#### 9.2.1. 作用域与命名空间示例  \n\n以下示例演示了如何引用不同作用域与命名空间，以及 `global` 和 `nonlocal` 如何影响变量绑定：\n\n```python\ndef scope_test():\n    def do_local():\n        spam = \"local spam\"\n    def do_nonlocal():\n        nonlocal spam\n        spam = \"nonlocal spam\"\n    def do_global():\n        global spam\n        spam = \"global spam\"\n    spam = \"test spam\"\n    do_local()\n    print(\"局部赋值后:\", spam)\n    do_nonlocal()\n    print(\"非局部赋值后:\", spam)\n    do_global()\n    print(\"全局赋值后:\", spam)\n\nscope_test()\nprint(\"全局作用域中:\", spam)\n```\n\n输出结果为：\n```\n局部赋值后: test spam\n非局部赋值后: nonlocal spam\n全局赋值后: nonlocal spam\n全局作用域中: global spam\n```\n\n注意：局部赋值（默认行为）并未改变 `scope_test` 中 `spam` 的绑定；`nonlocal` 赋值改变了 `scope_test` 的绑定；而 `global` 赋值则修改了模块级绑定。还可看出，在 `global` 赋值前，`spam` 并无先前绑定。\n\n---\n\n### 9.3. 类的初步认识  \n\n类引入了少量新语法、三种新对象类型及若干新语义。\n\n#### 9.3.1. 类定义语法  \n\n最简单的类定义形式如下：\n\n```python\nclass ClassName:\n    <语句-1>\n    ...\n    <语句-N>\n```\n\n类定义（如同函数定义 `def`）必须被执行后才生效（理论上可置于 `if` 分支或函数内部）。实践中，类定义内部的语句通常为函数定义，但也允许其他语句（有时很有用，后文详述）。类内函数定义通常具有特殊参数列表形式（由方法调用约定决定，后文解释）。\n\n当进入类定义时，会创建一个新的命名空间并作为局部作用域——因此所有局部变量赋值均进入此新命名空间；特别地，函数定义会将新函数名绑定于此。当正常退出类定义（到达末尾）时，会创建一个类对象，本质上是封装了该命名空间内容的容器；下一节将深入讨论类对象。原始局部作用域（进入类定义前的有效作用域）被恢复，且类对象被绑定到类定义头中指定的类名（如示例中的 `ClassName`）。\n\n#### 9.3.2. 类对象  \n\n类对象支持两类操作：属性引用与实例化。\n\n- **属性引用** 使用标准语法 `obj.name`。有效属性名即类对象创建时其命名空间中存在的所有名称。例如：\n\n  ```python\n  class MyClass:\n      \"\"\"一个简单示例类\"\"\"\n      i = 12345\n      def f(self):\n          return 'hello world'\n  ```\n\n  则 `MyClass.i` 与 `MyClass.f` 均为有效属性引用，分别返回整数与函数对象。类属性亦可赋值（如修改 `MyClass.i`）。`__doc__` 也是有效属性，返回类文档字符串 `\"A simple example class\"`。\n\n- **实例化** 使用函数调用语法：将类对象视作无参函数，返回该类的新实例。例如：\n\n  ```python\n  x = MyClass()\n  ```\n\n  创建新实例并赋给局部变量 `x`。实例化操作（即“调用”类对象）创建一个空对象。许多类希望实例具有特定初始状态，因此可定义特殊方法 `__init__()`：\n\n  ```python\n  def __init__(self):\n      self.data = []\n  ```\n\n  当类定义了 `__init__()`，实例化时会自动调用它。因此上述例子中，`x = MyClass()` 即获得初始化后的实例。\n\n  当然，`__init__()` 可接受参数以增强灵活性；此时传给类实例化操作符的参数会转发给 `__init__()`。例如：\n\n  ```python\n  >>> class Complex:\n  ...     def __init__(self, realpart, imagpart):\n  ...         self.r = realpart\n  ...         self.i = imagpart\n  ...\n  >>> x = Complex(3.0, -4.5)\n  >>> x.r, x.i\n  (3.0, -4.5)\n  ```\n\n#### 9.3.3. 实例对象  \n\n实例对象仅支持属性引用操作。有效属性名分为两类：数据属性与方法。\n\n- **数据属性** 对应 Smalltalk 中的“实例变量”或 C++ 中的“数据成员”。无需预先声明，首次赋值时即自动创建（类似局部变量）。例如，若 `x` 为前述 `MyClass` 的实例：\n\n  ```python\n  x.counter = 1\n  while x.counter < 10:\n      x.counter = x.counter * 2\n  print(x.counter)  # 输出 16\n  del x.counter\n  ```\n\n  此代码打印 `16`，且不留下痕迹。\n\n- **方法** 是“属于”对象的函数。实例的有效方法名取决于其类：类中所有函数对象属性均定义了对应实例的方法。因此在示例中，`x.f` 是有效方法引用（因 `MyClass.f` 是函数），而 `x.i` 不是（因 `MyClass.i` 非函数）。但注意：`x.f` 并非 `MyClass.f`——它是方法对象（method object），而非函数对象。\n\n#### 9.3.4. 方法对象  \n\n通常方法在绑定后立即调用：`x.f()`。若 `x = MyClass()`，则返回字符串 `'hello world'`。但方法不必立即调用：`x.f` 是方法对象，可存储并在后续调用。例如：\n\n```python\nxf = x.f\nwhile True:\n    print(xf())  # 永久输出 hello world\n```\n\n那么，调用方法时究竟发生了什么？你可能注意到：`x.f()` 未传参数，但函数 `f()` 定义却要求一个参数。参数去哪了？显然，若函数需参数却未传入，Python 应抛出异常……答案是：方法的特殊之处在于，实例对象被作为第一个参数传入函数。在示例中，`x.f()` 等价于 `MyClass.f(x)`。一般而言，调用含 `n` 个参数的方法，等价于调用对应函数，其参数列表为：实例对象 + 原始参数列表。\n\n方法工作原理如下：当引用实例的非数据属性时，首先搜索其类；若该名称对应一个有效的类属性且为函数对象，则将实例对象与函数对象打包为方法对象；当调用该方法对象时，构造新参数列表（实例对象 + 原始参数），并以此调用函数对象。\n\n#### 9.3.5. 类变量与实例变量  \n\n一般而言，实例变量用于存储各实例独有的数据，类变量则用于所有实例共享的属性与方法：\n\n```python\nclass Dog:\n    kind = 'canine'          # 类变量：所有实例共享\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name     # 实例变量：各实例独有\n\n>>> d = Dog('Fido')\n>>> e = Dog('Buddy')\n>>> d.kind   # 所有狗共享\n'canine'\n>>> e.kind\n'canine'\n>>> d.name   # d 独有\n'Fido'\n>>> e.name   # e 独有\n'Buddy'\n```\n\n如前所述（“关于名称与对象”），共享可变对象（如列表、字典）可能导致意外效果。例如，以下代码中将 `tricks` 作为类变量是错误的，因为所有 `Dog` 实例将共享同一列表：\n\n```python\nclass Dog:\n    tricks = []              # 错误：类变量误用\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n    def add_trick(self, trick):\n        self.tricks.append(trick)\n\n>>> d = Dog('Fido')\n>>> e = Dog('Buddy')\n>>> d.add_trick('roll over')\n>>> e.add_trick('play dead')\n>>> d.tricks                 # 意外共享！\n['roll over', 'play dead']\n```\n\n正确设计应使用实例变量：\n\n```python\nclass Dog:\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n        self.tricks = []     # 为每只狗创建新空列表\n    def add_trick(self, trick):\n        self.tricks.append(trick)\n\n>>> d = Dog('Fido')\n>>> e = Dog('Buddy')\n>>> d.add_trick('roll over')\n>>> e.add_trick('play dead')\n>>> d.tricks\n['roll over']\n>>> e.tricks\n['play dead']\n```\n\n---\n\n### 9.4. 随意杂谈  \n\n若实例与类中存在同名属性，则优先查找实例：\n\n```python\n>>> class Warehouse:\n...     purpose = 'storage'\n...     region = 'west'\n...\n>>> w1 = Warehouse()\n>>> print(w1.purpose, w1.region)\nstorage west\n>>> w2 = Warehouse()\n>>> w2.region = 'east'\n>>> print(w2.purpose, w2.region)\nstorage east\n```\n\n数据属性既可被方法引用，也可被普通用户（“客户端”）访问。换言之，类无法用于实现纯粹的抽象数据类型。事实上，Python 中无任何机制强制数据隐藏——一切基于约定。（另一方面，用 C 编写的 Python 解释器本身可完全隐藏实现细节并控制对象访问；C 编写的 Python 扩展可利用此特性。）\n\n客户端应谨慎使用数据属性——不当修改可能破坏方法维护的不变量。注意：客户端可在实例上添加自有数据属性而不影响方法有效性（只要避免名称冲突）；命名约定可大幅减少此类问题。\n\n方法内部无简写方式引用数据属性（或其他方法！）。我认为这反而提升了可读性：浏览方法时，局部变量与实例变量绝不会混淆。方法的第一个参数常命名为 `self`，但这仅为惯例——`self` 对 Python 无特殊含义。不过，不遵守此惯例会使代码对其他 Python 程序员更难读，且某些类浏览器工具可能依赖此约定。\n\n任何作为类属性的函数对象均定义了该类实例的方法。函数定义不必文本上位于类定义内部：将函数对象赋值给类内的局部变量同样可行。例如：\n\n```python\n# 类外部定义的函数\ndef f1(self, x, y):\n    return min(x, x+y)\n\nclass C:\n    f = f1\n    def g(self):\n        return 'hello world'\n    h = g\n```\n\n此时 `f`、`g`、`h` 均为类 `C` 的属性，指向函数对象，因而都是 `C` 实例的方法——`h` 与 `g` 完全等价。注意：此做法通常只会使读者困惑\n\n方法可通过 `self` 参数的方法属性调用其他方法：\n\n```python\nclass Bag:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.data = []\n    def add(self, x):\n        self.data.append(x)\n    def addtwice(self, x):\n        self.add(x)\n        self.add(x)\n```\n\n方法可像普通函数一样引用全局名称；其关联的全局作用域是定义该方法的模块（类本身永不会作为全局作用域）。虽然在方法中使用全局数据较少见，但全局作用域有诸多合法用途：例如，导入至全局作用域的函数与模块可被方法使用，其中定义的函数与类亦然。通常，包含该方法的类本身也定义于此全局作用域中；下一节将说明方法为何需要引用自身类。\n\n每个值都是对象，因此都有一个类（亦称类型），存储为 `object.__class__`。\n\n---\n\n### 9.5. 继承  \n\n当然，若无继承支持，语言特性便不配称为“类”。派生类定义语法如下：\n\n```python\nclass DerivedClassName(BaseClassName):\n    <语句-1>\n    ...\n    <语句-N>\n```\n\n基类名 `BaseClassName` 必须在派生类定义所在作用域的可访问命名空间中定义。除基类名外，任意表达式亦可作为基类（例如，当基类位于其他模块时）：\n\n```python\nclass DerivedClassName(modname.BaseClassName):\n```\n\n派生类定义的执行过程与基类相同。构造类对象时，基类会被记录下来，用于属性查找：若类中未找到请求的属性，则继续在基类中搜索；若基类自身派生自其他类，则递归应用此规则\n\n派生类的实例化无特殊之处：`DerivedClassName()` 创建该类的新实例\n\n方法查找规则如下：首先搜索对应类属性，必要时沿基类链向下查找；若最终得到函数对象，则方法引用有效。派生类可重写基类方法。由于方法调用其他方法时无特殊权限，基类中调用另一方法的代码，可能最终调用派生类中重写的版本。（对 C++ 程序员：Python 中所有方法本质上均为虚函数。）\n\n派生类中的重写方法常需扩展而非简单替换基类方法。直接调用基类方法的简洁方式是：`BaseClassName.methodname(self, arguments)`。这对客户端有时也很有用。（注意：此法仅当基类在全局作用域中可通过 `BaseClassName` 访问时有效。）\n\nPython 提供两个内置函数支持继承：\n- `isinstance(obj, int)`：仅当 `obj.__class__` 为 `int` 或其派生类时返回 `True`；\n- `issubclass(bool, int)`：因 `bool` 是 `int` 的子类，返回 `True`；而 `issubclass(float, int)` 为 `False`。\n\n#### 9.5.1. 多重继承  \n\nPython 也支持多重继承。含多个基类的类定义如下：\n\n```python\nclass DerivedClassName(Base1, Base2, Base3):\n    <语句-1>\n    ...\n    <语句-N>\n```\n\n在最简单情形下，可将父类属性查找理解为：深度优先、从左到右，且同一类不重复搜索。即：若 `DerivedClassName` 中未找到属性，则依次搜索 `Base1` → `Base1` 的基类（递归）→ `Base2` → ……\n\n实际上更复杂：方法解析顺序（MRO）动态调整以支持 `super()` 的协作调用。此机制在其他多继承语言中称为 `call-next-method`，比单继承语言中的 `super` 更强大。动态排序必不可少，因为所有多重继承场景均存在“菱形关系”（即至少一个父类可通过多条路径从最底层类到达）。例如，所有类均继承自 `object`，故多重继承必然提供多条通向 `object` 的路径。为避免基类被多次访问，动态算法以线性化方式排列搜索顺序，确保：  \n1. 保留各类中指定的从左到右顺序；  \n2. 每个父类仅调用一次；  \n3. 单调性（即子类化不影响父类优先级顺序）。  \n\n这些特性共同使设计可靠、可扩展的多重继承类成为可能。详情参见《Python 2.3 方法解析顺序》。\n\n---\n\n### 9.6. 私有变量  \n\nPython 中不存在真正意义上的“私有”实例变量（即仅限对象内部访问）。但遵循一种广泛使用的约定：以下划线开头的名称（如 `_spam`）应视为 API 的非公开部分（无论其为函数、方法或数据成员），属于实现细节，可能随时变更。\n\n为避免子类定义的名称与基类成员冲突，Python 提供有限的“名称改写”（name mangling）机制：形如 `__spam`（至少两个前导下划线，最多一个尾随下划线）的标识符，在类定义内部会被文本替换为 `_classname__spam`，其中 `classname` 为当前类名（去除前导下划线）。此改写无视标识符语法位置，只要出现在类定义内即生效。详见《私有名称改写规范》。\n\n名称改写有助于子类重写方法时不影响类内方法调用。例如：\n\n```python\nclass Mapping:\n    def __init__(self, iterable):\n        self.items_list = []\n        self.__update(iterable)  # 调用私有方法\n    def update(self, iterable):\n        for item in iterable:\n            self.items_list.append(item)\n    __update = update  # 原始 update() 的私有副本\n\nclass MappingSubclass(Mapping):\n    def update(self, keys, values):\n        # 提供 update() 新签名\n        # 但不破坏 __init__() 中的 __update 调用\n        for item in zip(keys, values):\n            self.items_list.append(item)\n```\n\n即使 `MappingSubclass` 引入了 `__update`，它在 `Mapping` 中被改写为 `_Mapping__update`，而在 `MappingSubclass` 中为 `_MappingSubclass__update`，互不干扰\n\n注意：改写规则主要防误用；仍可访问或修改“私有”变量——这在调试等特殊场景下甚至很有用。需留意：传给 `exec()` 或 `eval()` 的代码不将调用类的类名视为当前类（类似 `global` 语句效果，仅限字节编译的代码块）；此限制同样适用于 `getattr()`、`setattr()`、`delattr()` 及直接引用 `__dict__`。\n\n---\n\n### 9.7. 零碎补充  \n\n有时需要类似 Pascal “record” 或 C “struct” 的数据类型，将若干命名数据项捆绑在一起。惯用做法是使用 `dataclasses`：\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n\n@dataclass\nclass Employee:\n    name: str\n    dept: str\n    salary: int\n\n>>> john = Employee('john', 'computer lab', 1000)\n>>> john.dept\n'computer lab'\n>>> john.salary\n1000\n```\n\n期望特定抽象数据类型的 Python 代码，常可传入模拟其方法的类替代。例如，若某函数需格式化文件对象数据，可定义一个类，其 `read()` 与 `readline()` 方法从字符串缓冲区读取数据，并将其作为参数传入。\n\n实例方法对象也有属性：`m.__self__` 为拥有方法 `m` 的实例对象，`m.__func__` 为对应函数对象。\n\n---\n\n### 9.8. 迭代器  \n\n你可能已注意到，多数容器对象可用 `for` 语句遍历：\n\n```python\nfor element in [1, 2, 3]: print(element)\nfor element in (1, 2, 3): print(element)\nfor key in {'one':1, 'two':2}: print(key)\nfor char in \"123\": print(char)\nfor line in open(\"myfile.txt\"): print(line, end='')\n```\n\n这种访问方式清晰、简洁、便捷。迭代器机制贯穿并统一了 Python。\n\n幕后机制：`for` 语句对容器对象调用 `iter()`，返回一个迭代器对象，其定义 `__next__()` 方法逐个访问容器元素。当无更多元素时，`__next__()` 抛出 `StopIteration` 异常，通知 `for` 循环终止。可使用内置函数 `next()` 调用 `__next__()`，示例如下：\n\n```python\n>>> s = 'abc'\n>>> it = iter(s)\n>>> it\n<str_iterator object at 0x10c90e650>\n>>> next(it)\n'a'\n>>> next(it)\n'b'\n>>> next(it)\n'c'\n>>> next(it)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nnext(it)\nStopIteration\n```\n\n理解迭代器协议后，即可轻松为自定义类添加迭代行为：定义 `__iter__()` 方法返回一个含 `__next__()` 方法的对象；若类已定义 `__next__()`，则 `__iter__()` 可直接返回 `self`：\n\n```python\nclass Reverse:\n    \"\"\"反向遍历序列的迭代器\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, data):\n        self.data = data\n        self.index = len(data)\n    def __iter__(self):\n        return self\n    def __next__(self):\n        if self.index == 0:\n            raise StopIteration\n        self.index -= 1\n        return self.data[self.index]\n\n>>> rev = Reverse('spam')\n>>> iter(rev)\n<__main__.Reverse object at 0x00A1DB50>\n>>> for char in rev:\n...     print(char)\n...\nm\na\np\ns\n```\n\n---\n\n### 9.9. 生成器  \n\n生成器是创建迭代器的简单而强大的工具。其编写类似普通函数，但使用 `yield` 语句返回数据。每次调用 `next()` 时，生成器从上次暂停处恢复执行（自动保存所有局部变量及最后执行的语句）。示例如下：\n\n```python\ndef reverse(data):\n    for index in range(len(data)-1, -1, -1):\n        yield data[index]\n\n>>> for char in reverse('golf'):\n...     print(char)\n...\nf\nl\no\ng\n```\n\n生成器能完成的一切，均可通过上节所述的基于类的迭代器实现。生成器的优势在于：  \n1. 自动创建 `__iter__()` 与 `__next__()` 方法;  \n2. 自动保存局部变量与执行状态；  \n3. 终止时自动抛出 `StopIteration`。  \n\n这些特性使其编写比使用 `self.index`、`self.data` 等实例变量的方法更简洁清晰。综合而言，创建迭代器几乎与编写普通函数一样省力。\n\n---\n\n### 9.10. 生成器表达式  \n\n某些简单生成器可用类似列表推导式的语法简洁表达，但使用圆括号而非方括号。此类表达式适用于生成器被立即由外围函数使用的场景。生成器表达式比完整生成器定义更紧凑，但灵活性较低；且通常比等效的列表推导式更节省内存。示例如下：\n\n```python\n>>> sum(i*i for i in range(10))           # 平方和\n285\n>>> xvec = [10, 20, 30]\n>>> yvec = [7, 5, 3]\n>>> sum(x*y for x,y in zip(xvec, yvec))  # 点积\n260\n>>> unique_words = set(word for line in page for word in line.split())\n>>> valedictorian = max((student.gpa, student.name) for student in graduates)\n>>> data = 'golf'\n>>> list(data[i] for i in range(len(data)-1, -1, -1))\n['f', 'l', 'o', 'g']\n```\n\n---\n\n**脚注**  \n[1] 例外情况：模块对象有一个秘密的只读属性 `__dict__`，返回用于实现模块命名空间的字典；`__dict__` 是属性而非全局名称。显然，使用它违反了命名空间实现的抽象，应仅限事后调试器等场景使用\n\n---\n\n**目录**  \n9. 类  \n9.1. 关于名称与对象的一点说明  \n9.2.

Python 3.14 a été publié le 7 octobre 2025. Pour plus de détails, consultez le journal des modifications. Voir aussi PEP 745 – Calendrier de publication de Python 3.14 Résumé – Points forts de la version¶ Python 3.14 est la dernière version stable du langage de programmation Python, avec une combinaison de changements apportés au langage, à son implémentation et à sa bibliothèque standard. Les changements les plus importants incluent les littéraux de chaînes de modèle, l’évaluation différée des annotations et le support des sous-interpréteurs dans la bibliothèque standard. Les changements apportés à la bibliothèque incluent des capacités d’inspection considérablement améliorées dans asyncio, le support de Zstandard via un nouveau module compression.zstd, la coloration syntaxique dans le REPL, ainsi que les dépréciations et suppressions habituelles, et des améliorations en termes d’utilisabilité et de correction. Cet article n’a pas pour but de fournir une spécification complète de toutes les nouvelles fonctionnalités, mais plutôt de donner un aperçu pratique. Pour plus de détails, reportez-vous à la documentation, telle que la Référence de la bibliothèque et la Référence du langage. Pour comprendre l’implémentation complète et la justification conceptuelle d’un changement, reportez-vous à la PEP correspondante à une nouvelle fonctionnalité ; notez toutefois que les PEP sont généralement mises à jour une fois qu’une fonctionnalité a été entièrement mise en œuvre. Consultez Migration vers Python 3.14 pour des conseils sur la mise à niveau depuis des versions antérieures de Python. Améliorations de l’interpréteur : PEP 649 et PEP 749 : Évaluation différée des annotations PEP 734 : Plusieurs interpréteurs dans la bibliothèque standard PEP 750 : Chaînes de modèle PEP 758 : Autoriser les expressions except et except* sans crochets PEP 765 : Flux de contrôle dans les blocs finally PEP 768 : Interface sécurisée pour débogueurs externes pour CPython Un nouveau type d’interpréteur Améliorations du mode multithread sans GIL Messages d’erreur améliorés Collecte des ordures incrémentale Améliorations significatives dans la bibliothèque standard : PEP 784 : Support de Zstandard dans la bibliothèque standard Capacités d’inspection asyncio Contrôle sécurisé des avertissements simultanés Coloration syntaxique dans le shell interactif par défaut, et sortie colorée dans plusieurs interfaces en ligne de commande de la bibliothèque standard Améliorations de l’API C : PEP 741 : API C de configuration Python Support de plateforme : PEP 776 : Emscripten est désormais une plateforme officiellement supportée, au niveau 3. Changements de publication : PEP 779 : Le Python multithread sans GIL est officiellement supporté PEP 761 : Les signatures PGP ont été abandonnées pour les publications officielles Les versions binaires pour Windows et macOS prennent désormais en charge le compilateur juste-à-temps expérimental Des versions binaires pour Android sont désormais fournies Nouvelles fonctionnalités¶ PEP 649 & PEP 749 : Évaluation différée des annotations¶ Les annotations sur les fonctions, classes et modules ne sont plus évaluées immédiatement. Au lieu de cela, les annotations sont stockées dans des fonctions spéciales d’annotation et évaluées uniquement lorsque nécessaire (sauf si from __future__ import annotations est utilisé). Ce changement vise à améliorer les performances et l’utilisabilité des annotations en Python dans la plupart des cas. Le coût d’exécution pour définir des annotations est minimisé, mais il reste possible d’inspecter les annotations à l’exécution. Il n’est plus nécessaire d’encadrer les annotations entre guillemets si elles contiennent des références avant. Le nouveau module annotationlib fournit des outils pour inspecter les annotations différées. Les annotations peuvent être évaluées selon trois formats : VALUE (qui évalue les annotations en valeurs d’exécution, similaire au comportement des versions antérieures de Python), FORWARDREF (qui remplace les noms non définis par des marqueurs spéciaux), et STRING (qui retourne les annotations sous forme de chaînes). Cet exemple montre comment ces formats se comportent : >>> from annotationlib import get_annotations, Format >>> def func(arg: Undefined): ... pass >>> get_annotations(func, format=Format.VALUE) Traceback (most recent call last): ... NameError: name 'Undefined' is not defined >>> get_annotations(func, format=Format.FORWARDREF) {'arg': ForwardRef('Undefined', owner=<function func at 0x...>)} >>> get_annotations(func, format=Format.STRING) {'arg': 'Undefined'} La section migration contient des conseils sur les changements qui pourraient être nécessaires en raison de ces modifications, bien que dans la majorité des cas, le code continuera de fonctionner tel quel. (Contribué par Jelle Zijlstra dans PEP 749 et gh-119180 ; PEP 649 a été rédigée par Larry Hastings.) Voir aussi PEP 649Évaluation différée des annotations utilisant des descripteurs PEP 749Mise en œuvre de PEP 649 PEP 734 : Plusieurs interpréteurs dans la bibliothèque standard¶ Le runtime CPython prend en charge l’exécution de plusieurs copies de Python dans le même processus simultanément, ce qu’il fait depuis plus de 20 ans. Chacune de ces copies séparées est appelée un « interpréteur ». Toutefois, cette fonctionnalité n’était accessible que via l’API C. Cette limitation est levée dans Python 3.14, avec le nouveau module concurrent.interpreters. Il existe au moins deux raisons notables pour lesquelles l’utilisation de plusieurs interpréteurs présente des avantages significatifs : ils permettent un nouveau modèle de concurrence convivial pour les humains (nouveau pour Python) le parallélisme multi-cœurs véritable Pour certains cas d'utilisation, la concurrence dans les logiciels améliore l'efficacité et peut simplifier la conception, à un niveau élevé. En même temps, la mise en œuvre et la maintenance de toute concurrence autre que la plus simple sont souvent un défi pour le cerveau humain. Cela s'applique particulièrement aux threads simples (par exemple, threading), où toute la mémoire est partagée entre tous les threads. Avec plusieurs interpréteurs isolés, vous pouvez tirer parti d'une classe de modèles de concurrence, comme les Processus Séquentiels Communicants (CSP) ou le modèle acteur, qui ont trouvé leur succès dans d'autres langages de programmation, comme Smalltalk, Erlang, Haskell et Go. Considérez plusieurs interpréteurs comme des threads avec un partage opt-in. En ce qui concerne le parallélisme multi-cœurs : à partir de Python 3.12, les interpréteurs sont maintenant suffisamment isolés les uns des autres pour être utilisés en parallèle (voir PEP 684). Cela débloque une variété d'utilisations intensives en CPU pour Python qui étaient limitées par le GIL. L'utilisation de plusieurs interpréteurs est similaire à de nombreux égards au multiprocessing, car ils fournissent tous deux des \"processus\" logiques isolés pouvant s'exécuter en parallèle, sans partage par défaut. Toutefois, lors de l'utilisation de plusieurs interpréteurs, une application utilisera moins de ressources système et fonctionnera plus efficacement (car elle reste dans le même processus). Considérez plusieurs interpréteurs comme ayant l'isolement des processus avec l'efficacité des threads. Bien que la fonctionnalité existe depuis des décennies, plusieurs interpréteurs n'ont pas été largement utilisés, en raison d'une faible sensibilisation et du manque d'un module de la bibliothèque standard. Par conséquent, ils présentent actuellement plusieurs limitations notables, qui devraient s'améliorer considérablement maintenant que la fonctionnalité entre dans le courant dominant. Limitations actuelles : le démarrage de chaque interpréteur n'a pas encore été optimisé chaque interpréteur utilise plus de mémoire que nécessaire (le travail continue sur le partage interne étendu entre les interpréteurs) il n'y a pas encore beaucoup d'options pour partager réellement des objets ou d'autres données entre les interpréteurs (autre que memoryview) de nombreux modules d'extension tiers sur PyPI ne sont pas encore compatibles avec plusieurs interpréteurs (tous les modules d'extension de la bibliothèque standard sont compatibles) l'approche pour écrire des applications utilisant plusieurs interpréteurs isolés est principalement inconnue des utilisateurs de Python, pour le moment L'impact de ces limitations dépendra des améliorations futures de CPython, de la manière dont les interpréteurs sont utilisés et de ce que la communauté résout via les packages PyPI. Selon le cas d'utilisation, les limitations peuvent avoir peu d'impact, alors essayez-le ! De plus, les futures versions de CPython réduiront ou élimineront les surcoûts et fourniront des utilitaires moins appropriés sur PyPI. En attendant, la plupart des limitations peuvent également être résolues via des modules d'extension, ce qui signifie que les packages PyPI peuvent combler tout écart pour 3.14, et même jusqu'à 3.12 où les interpréteurs étaient enfin correctement isolés et ont cessé de partager le GIL. De même, on s'attend à ce que des bibliothèques sur PyPI émergent pour des abstractions de haut niveau au-dessus des interpréteurs. En ce qui concerne les modules d'extension, des travaux sont en cours pour mettre à jour certains projets PyPI, ainsi que des outils comme Cython, pybind11, nanobind et PyO3. Les étapes pour isoler un module d'extension sont trouvées à Isoler les modules d'extension. Isoler un module a beaucoup de chevauchement avec ce qui est requis pour supporter le multithreading sans GIL, donc les travaux en cours dans la communauté dans ce domaine aideront à accélérer le support de plusieurs interpréteurs. Ajouté également dans 3.14 : concurrent.futures.InterpreterPoolExecutor. (Contribué par Eric Snow dans gh-134939.) Voir aussi PEP 734 PEP 750 : Littéraux de chaînes de modèle¶ Les chaînes de modèle sont un nouveau mécanisme pour le traitement personnalisé des chaînes. Elles partagent la syntaxe familière des f-strings mais, contrairement aux f-strings, retournent un objet représentant les parties statiques et interpolées de la chaîne, au lieu d'un simple str. Pour écrire une t-string, utilisez un préfixe 't' au lieu d'un 'f' : >>> variety = 'Stilton' >>> template = t'Try some {variety} cheese!' >>> type(template) <class 'string.templatelib.Template'> Les objets Template fournissent un accès aux parties statiques et interpolées (entre accolades) d'une chaîne avant qu'elles ne soient combinées. Itérez sur les instances Template pour accéder à leurs parties dans l'ordre : >>> list(template) ['Try some ', Interpolation('Stilton', 'variety', None, ''), ' cheese!'] Il est facile d'écrire (ou d'appeler) du code pour traiter les instances Template. Par exemple, voici une fonction qui rend les parties statiques en minuscules et les instances Interpolation en majuscules : from string.templatelib import Interpolation def lower_upper(template): \"\"\"Rend les parties statiques en minuscules et les interpolations en majuscules.\"\"\" parts = [] for part in template: if isinstance(part, Interpolation): parts.append(str(part.value).upper()) else: parts.append(part.lower()) return ''.join(parts) name = 'Wenslydale' template = t'Mister {name}' assert lower_upper(template) == 'mister WENSLYDALE' Comme les instances Template distinguent les chaînes statiques et les interpolations à l'exécution, elles peuvent être utiles pour nettoyer les entrées utilisateur. Écrire une fonction html() qui échappe les entrées utilisateur en HTML est un exercice laissé au lecteur ! Le code de traitement des templates peut offrir une flexibilité améliorée. Par exemple, une fonction html() plus avancée pourrait accepter un dictionnaire d'attributs HTML directement dans le template : attributes = {'src': 'limburger.jpg', 'alt': 'lovely cheese'} template = t'<img {attributes}>' assert html(template) == '<img src=\"limburger.jpg\" alt=\"lovely cheese\" />' Bien sûr, le code de traitement des templates n'a pas besoin de retourner un résultat semblable à une chaîne. Une fonction html() encore plus avancée pourrait retourner un type personnalisé représentant une structure de type DOM. Avec les t-strings en place, les développeurs peuvent écrire des systèmes qui nettoient SQL, rendent les opérations shell sûres, améliorent la journalisation, abordent des idées modernes en développement web (HTML, CSS, etc.), et mettent en œuvre des DSL métier légers personnalisés.

Voir aussi PEP 750. PEP 768 : Interface sécurisée pour débogueurs externes¶ Python 3.14 introduit une interface de débogage sans surcharge qui permet aux débogueurs et profileurs de se connecter en toute sécurité à des processus Python en cours d'exécution sans les arrêter ou les redémarrer. Il s'agit d'une amélioration significative des capacités de débogage de Python, ce qui signifie que des alternatives dangereuses ne sont plus nécessaires. La nouvelle interface fournit des points d'exécution sécurisés pour attacher du code de débogage sans modifier le chemin d'exécution normal de l'interpréteur ou ajouter une surcharge à l'exécution. Grâce à cela, les outils peuvent désormais inspecter et interagir avec des applications Python en temps réel, ce qui est une capacité cruciale pour les systèmes à haute disponibilité et les environnements de production. Pour plus de commodité, cette interface est implémentée dans la fonction sys.remote_exec(). Par exemple : import sys from tempfile import NamedTemporaryFile with NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w', suffix='.py', delete=False) as f: script_path = f.name f.write(f'import my_debugger; my_debugger.connect({os.getpid()})') # Exécuter dans le processus avec PID 1234 print('Voilà ! Une offrande :') sys.remote_exec(1234, script_path) Cette fonction permet d'envoyer du code Python à exécuter dans un processus cible au prochain point d'exécution sécurisé. Toutefois, les auteurs d'outils peuvent également implémenter le protocole directement comme décrit dans la PEP, qui détaille les mécanismes sous-jacents utilisés pour se connecter en toute sécurité à des processus en cours d'exécution. L'interface de débogage a été conçue avec soin en tenant compte de la sécurité et inclut plusieurs mécanismes pour contrôler l'accès : Une variable d'environnement PYTHON_DISABLE_REMOTE_DEBUG. Une option de ligne de commande -X disable-remote-debug. Un indicateur de configuration --without-remote-debug pour désactiver complètement la fonctionnalité au moment de la compilation. (Contribué par Pablo Galindo Salgado, Matt Wozniski et Ivona Stojanovic dans gh-131591.) Voir aussi PEP 768. Un nouveau type d'interpréteur¶ Un nouveau type d'interpréteur a été ajouté à CPython. Il utilise des appels de queue entre de petites fonctions C qui implémentent des opcodes Python individuels, plutôt qu'une grande instruction case C. Pour certains compilateurs plus récents, cet interpréteur offre des performances nettement meilleures. Des benchmarks préliminaires suggèrent une moyenne géométrique de 3 à 5 % plus rapide sur la suite de benchmarks standard pyperformance, selon la plateforme et l'architecture. La référence est Python 3.14 construit avec Clang 19, sans ce nouvel interpréteur. Cet interpréteur ne fonctionne actuellement qu'avec Clang 19 et ultérieur sur les architectures x86-64 et AArch64. Toutefois, une future version de GCC devrait également prendre en charge cela. Cette fonctionnalité est facultative pour le moment. L'activation de l'optimisation guidée par le profil est fortement recommandée lors de l'utilisation du nouvel interpréteur, car c'est la seule configuration qui a été testée et validée pour une meilleure performance. Pour plus d'informations, voir --with-tail-call-interp. Note Ceci ne doit pas être confondu avec l'optimisation des appels de queue des fonctions Python, qui n'est actuellement pas implémentée dans CPython. Ce nouveau type d'interpréteur est un détail d'implémentation interne de l'interpréteur CPython. Il ne change en aucun cas le comportement visible des programmes Python. Il peut améliorer leurs performances, mais ne modifie rien d'autre. (Contribué par Ken Jin dans gh-128563, avec des idées sur la façon de mettre en œuvre cela dans CPython par Mark Shannon, Garrett Gu, Haoran Xu et Josh Haberman.) Améliorations du mode multithread sans GIL¶ Le mode multithread sans GIL de CPython (PEP 703), initialement ajouté dans 3.13, a été considérablement amélioré dans Python 3.14. L'implémentation décrite dans la PEP 703 a été finalisée, y compris les changements d'API C, et les solutions de contournement temporaires dans l'interpréteur ont été remplacés par des solutions plus permanentes. L'interpréteur adaptatif spécialisé (PEP 659) est désormais activé en mode multithread sans GIL, ce qui, associé à de nombreuses autres optimisations, améliore considérablement ses performances. La pénalité de performance sur le code monothread en mode multithread sans GIL est désormais d'environ 5 à 10 %, selon la plateforme et le compilateur C utilisé. À partir de Python 3.14, lors de la compilation de modules d'extension pour la version multithread sans GIL de CPython sur Windows, la variable de préprocesseur Py_GIL_DISABLED doit désormais être spécifiée par le backend de construction, car elle ne sera plus déterminée automatiquement par le compilateur C. Pour un interpréteur en cours d'exécution, le paramètre utilisé au moment de la compilation peut être trouvé en utilisant sysconfig.get_config_var(). Le nouveau drapeau -X context_aware_warnings contrôle si le contrôle sécurisé des avertissements simultanés est activé. Le drapeau est activé par défaut pour la version multithread sans GIL et désactivé pour la version avec GIL. Un nouveau drapeau thread_inherit_context a été ajouté, qui, s'il est activé, signifie que les threads créés avec threading.Thread commencent avec une copie du Context() de l'appelant de start(). Le plus important, ceci permet que le contexte de filtrage des avertissements établi par catch_warnings soit « hérité » par les threads (ou les tâches asyncio) démarrés dans ce contexte. Cela affecte également d'autres modules utilisant des variables de contexte, comme le gestionnaire de contexte decimal. Ce drapeau est activé par défaut pour la version multithread sans GIL et désactivé pour la version avec GIL.

Certains de ces contributeurs sont employés par Meta, qui continue de fournir des ressources d'ingénierie importantes pour soutenir ce projet.) Messages d'erreur améliorés¶ L'interpréteur fournit désormais des suggestions utiles lorsqu'il détecte des fautes de frappe dans les mots-clés Python. Lorsqu'un mot ressemblant étroitement à un mot-clé Python est rencontré, l'interpréteur suggérera le mot-clé correct dans le message d'erreur. Cette fonctionnalité aide les programmeurs à identifier rapidement et à corriger les erreurs de frappe courantes. Par exemple : >>> whille True: ... pass Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\", line 1 whille True: ^^^^^^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Did you mean 'while'? Bien que la fonctionnalité se concentre sur les cas les plus courants, certaines variations d'orthographes peuvent toujours entraîner des erreurs de syntaxe régulières. (Contribué par Pablo Galindo dans gh-132449.) Les instructions elif suivant un bloc else ont désormais un message d'erreur spécifique. (Contribué par Steele Farnsworth dans gh-129902.) >>> if who == \"me\": ... print(\"It's me!\") ... else: ... print(\"It's not me!\") ... elif who is None: ... print(\"Who is it?\") File \"<stdin>\", line 5 elif who is None: ^^^^ SyntaxError: 'elif' block follows an 'else' block Si une instruction est passée aux expressions conditionnelles après else, ou si l'une des instructions pass, break ou continue est passée avant if, le message d'erreur souligne où l'expression est requise. (Contribué par Sergey Miryanov dans gh-129515.) >>> x = 1 if True else pass Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<string>\", line 1 x = 1 if True else pass ^^^^ SyntaxError: expected expression after 'else', but statement is given >>> x = continue if True else break Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<string>\", line 1 x = continue if True else break ^^^^^^^^ SyntaxError: expected expression before 'if', but statement is given Lorsque des chaînes incorrectement fermées sont détectées, le message d'erreur suggère que la chaîne pourrait être destinée à faire partie de la chaîne. (Contribué par Pablo Galindo dans gh-88535.) >>> \"The interesting object \"The important object\" is very important\" Traceback (most recent call last): SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Is this intended to be part of the string? Lorsque les chaînes ont des préfixes incompatibles, l'erreur affiche désormais quels préfixes sont incompatibles. (Contribué par Nikita Sobolev dans gh-133197.) >>> ub'abc' File \"<python-input-0>\", line 1 ub'abc' ^^ SyntaxError: 'u' and 'b' prefixes are incompatible Messages d'erreur améliorés lors de l'utilisation de as avec des cibles incompatibles dans : Imports : import ... as ... Imports depuis : from ... import ... as ... Gestionnaires d'exceptions : except ... as ... Cas de correspondance de motifs : case ... as ... (Contribué par Nikita Sobolev dans gh-123539, gh-123562 et gh-123440.) Message d'erreur amélioré lorsqu'on essaie d'ajouter une instance d'un type non hachable à un dict ou set. (Contribué par CF Bolz-Tereick et Victor Stinner dans gh-132828.) >>> s = set() >>> s.add({'pages': 12, 'grade': 'A'}) Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<python-input-1>\", line 1, in <module> s.add({'pages': 12, 'grade': 'A'}) ~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ TypeError: cannot use 'dict' as a set element (unhashable type: 'dict') >>> d = {} >>> l = [1, 2, 3] >>> d[l] = 12 Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<python-input-4>\", line 1, in <module> d[l] = 12 ~^^^ TypeError: cannot use 'list' as a dict key (unhashable type: 'list') Message d'erreur amélioré lorsqu'un objet supportant le protocole de gestionnaire de contexte synchrone est entré en utilisant async with au lieu de with, et vice versa pour le protocole de gestionnaire de contexte asynchrone. (Contribué par Bénédikt Tran dans gh-128398.) PEP 784 : Support de Zstandard dans la bibliothèque standard¶ Le nouveau package compression contient des modules compression.lzma, compression.bz2, compression.gzip et compression.zlib qui ré-exportent respectivement les modules lzma, bz2, gzip et zlib. Les nouveaux noms d'importation sous compression sont les noms préférés pour importer ces modules de compression à partir de Python 3.14. Toutefois, les noms existants des modules n'ont pas été dépréciés. Toute dépréciation ou suppression des modules de compression existants n'interviendra pas avant cinq ans après la publication de 3.14. Le nouveau module compression.zstd fournit des API de compression et de décompression pour le format Zstandard via des liaisons à la bibliothèque zstd de Meta. Zstandard est un format de compression largement adopté, très efficace et rapide. En plus des API introduites dans compression.zstd, le support de la lecture et de l'écriture d'archives compressées Zstandard a été ajouté aux modules tarfile, zipfile et shutil. Voici un exemple d'utilisation du nouveau module pour compresser des données : from compression import zstd import math data = str(math.pi).encode() * 20 compressed = zstd.compress(data) ratio = len(compressed) / len(data) print(f\"Achieved compression ratio of {ratio}\") Comme on peut le voir, l'API est similaire aux API des modules lzma et bz2. (Contribué par Emma Harper Smith, Adam Turner, Gregory P. Smith, Tomas Roun, Victor Stinner et Rogdham dans gh-132983.) Voir aussi PEP 784. Capacités d'inspection asyncio¶ Ajout d'une nouvelle interface en ligne de commande pour inspecter les processus Python en cours d'exécution à l'aide de tâches asynchrones, disponible via python -m asyncio ps PID ou python -m asyncio pstree PID. La sous-commande ps inspecte l'ID de processus donné (PID) et affiche des informations sur les tâches asyncio actuellement en cours d'exécution. Elle produit un tableau de tâches : une liste plate de toutes les tâches, leurs noms, leurs piles de coroutines et quelles tâches les attendent. La sous-commande pstree récupère les mêmes informations, mais affiche plutôt un arbre visuel d'appels asynchrones, montrant les relations entre les coroutines dans un format hiérarchique. Cette commande est particulièrement utile pour déboguer des programmes asynchrones longs ou bloqués. Elle peut aider les développeurs à identifier rapidement où un programme est bloqué, quelles tâches sont en attente et comment les coroutines sont chaînées ensemble. Par exemple, étant donné ce code : import asyncio async def play_track(track): await asyncio.sleep(5) print(f'🎵 Finished: {track}') async def play_album(name, tracks): async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg: for track in tracks: tg.create_task(play_track(track), name=track) async def main(): async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg: tg.create_task( play_album('Sundowning', ['TNDNBTG', 'Levitate']), name='Sundowning') tg.create_task( play_album('TMBTE', ['DYWTYLM', 'Aqua Regia']), name='TMBTE') if __name__ == '__main__': asyncio.run(main()) L'exécution du nouvel outil sur le processus en cours produira un tableau comme celui-ci : python -m asyncio ps 12345 tid task id task name coroutine stack awaiter chain awaiter name awaiter id --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

    "llm_output_test2": "text: 9.2 Python 作用域与命名空间  \n\n在介绍类之前，我首先需要向您说明 Python 的作用域规则。类定义在命名空间的处理上有一些巧妙的机制，要完全理解其中的原理，您必须先了解作用域与命名空间的工作方式。顺便提一句，掌握这一主题的知识对任何高级 Python 程序员都非常有用。\n\n我们先从一些定义开始：  \n**命名空间（namespace）** 是一种将名称映射到对象的机制。目前大多数命名空间均以 Python 字典的形式实现，但通常这并不会被用户察觉（除性能影响外），且未来也可能发生变化1。命名空间的示例包括：内置名称集合（如 `abs()` 函数及内置异常名称）、模块中的全局名称，以及函数调用中的局部名称。从某种意义上说，一个对象的属性集合也构成一个命名空间\n\n关于命名空间，最重要的一点是：不同命名空间中的名称彼此完全无关；例如，两个不同的模块可以各自定义一个名为 `maximize` 的函数而不会产生冲突——模块使用者必须通过模块名加以限定引用。顺便说明，我将“点号后跟随的任何名称”称为**属性（attribute）**；例如，在表达式 `z.real` 中，`real` 即为对象 `z` 的一个属性。严格来说，对模块中名称的引用属于属性引用：在表达式 `modname.funcname` 中，`modname` 是一个模块对象，而 `funcname` 是它的属性。在此情况下，模块的属性与其内部定义的全局名称之间存在直接对应关系：它们共享同一个命名空间！[1]\n\n属性可以是只读的，也可以是可写的。对于后者，允许对属性进行赋值操作。模块属性是可写的：例如，您可以执行 `modname.the_answer = 42`。可写属性也可通过 `del` 语句删除；例如，`del modname.the_answer` 将从由 `modname` 所指代的对象中移除属性 `the_answer`。\n\n命名空间在不同时刻创建，并具有不同的生命周期：  \n- 包含内置名称的命名空间在 Python 解释器启动时创建，且永不销毁；  \n- 模块的全局命名空间在其定义被读入时创建；通常，模块命名空间会持续存在直至解释器退出；  \n- 由解释器顶层调用所执行的语句（无论是从脚本文件读取还是交互式输入）被视为一个名为 `__main__` 的模块的一部分，因此它们拥有自身的全局命名空间（内置名称实际上也位于一个名为 `builtins` 的模块中）；  \n- 函数的局部命名空间在其被调用时创建，并在其返回或抛出未在函数内部处理的异常时销毁（更准确地说，“遗忘”是对实际发生过程更贴切的描述）。当然，递归调用的每一层都拥有其独立的局部命名空间。\n\n**作用域（scope）** 是 Python 程序中一段文本区域，在该区域内某个命名空间可被直接访问。“直接访问”意味着对未加限定的名称的引用，会尝试在该命名空间中查找该名称。尽管作用域是在静态阶段确定的，但在运行时动态使用。在程序执行的任意时刻，总共有 3 或 4 层嵌套的作用域，其命名空间均可被直接访问：  \n1. 最内层作用域（最先搜索），包含局部名称；  \n2. 外围函数的作用域（从最近的外围作用域开始依次搜索），包含非局部但非全局的名称；  \n3. 倒数第二层作用域，包含当前模块的全局名称；  \n4. 最外层作用域（最后搜索），即包含内置名称的命名空间。\n\n若某名称被声明为 `global`，则所有对该名称的引用和赋值操作都将直接指向倒数第二层作用域（即模块的全局命名空间）。若需重新绑定位于最内层作用域之外的变量，可使用 `nonlocal` 语句；否则，这些变量仅可读取（试图写入此类变量仅会在最内层作用域中创建一个新的局部变量，而外部同名变量保持不变）。\n\n通常，局部作用域指向（文本上）当前函数的局部名称；而在函数外部，局部作用域与全局作用域引用同一命名空间：即模块的命名空间。类定义还会在局部作用域中引入另一个命名空间。\n\n重要的是要认识到：作用域是**按文本位置确定**的——例如，定义在模块内的函数，其全局作用域始终是该模块的命名空间，无论该函数从何处、以何种别名被调用。另一方面，名称的实际查找是在运行时动态完成的；然而，语言规范正逐步向“编译期”的静态名称解析演进，因此请勿依赖动态名称解析！（事实上，局部变量已采用静态方式确定。）\n\nPython 的一个特殊之处在于：若当前没有生效的 `global` 或 `nonlocal` 声明，则对名称的赋值操作总是作用于最内层作用域。赋值操作并不复制数据，而仅仅是将名称绑定到对象上。删除操作亦然：语句 `del x` 会从局部作用域所引用的命名空间中移除 `x` 的绑定。实际上，所有引入新名称的操作均使用局部作用域：特别是，`import` 语句和函数定义会将模块名或函数名绑定至局部作用域。`global` 语句可用于声明某些变量位于全局作用域并应在此处重新绑定；`nonlocal` 语句则用于声明某些变量位于外围作用域并应在此处重新绑定。\n\n---\n\n**9.2.1 作用域与命名空间示例**  \n\n以下示例演示了如何引用不同作用域与命名空间，以及 `global` 和 `nonlocal` 如何影响变量绑定：\n\n```python\ndef scope_test():\n    def do_local():\n        spam = \"local spam\"\n    def do_nonlocal():\n        nonlocal spam\n        spam = \"nonlocal spam\"\n    def do_global():\n        global spam\n        spam = \"global spam\"\n    spam = \"test spam\"\n    do_local()\n    print(\"After local assignment:\", spam)\n    do_nonlocal()\n    print(\"After nonlocal assignment:\", spam)\n    do_global()\n    print(\"After global assignment:\", spam)\n\nscope_test()\nprint(\"In global scope:\", spam)\n```\n\n上述代码的输出为：\n\n```\nAfter local assignment: test spam\nAfter nonlocal assignment: nonlocal spam\nAfter global assignment: nonlocal spam\nIn global scope: global spam\n```\n\n请注意：局部赋值（默认行为）并未改变 `scope_test` 中 `spam` 的绑定；而非局部赋值修改了 `scope_test` 中 `spam` 的绑定；全局赋值则修改了模块层级的绑定。此外，您还可观察到：在执行全局赋值前，`spam` 并无先前的绑定。\n\n---\n[1] 例外情况：模块对象有一个隐藏的只读属性 `__dict__`，它返回用于实现模块命名空间的字典；`__dict__` 是一个属性，但并非全局名称。显然，使用此特性会破坏命名空间实现的抽象性，应仅限于事后调试等特殊场景。",
